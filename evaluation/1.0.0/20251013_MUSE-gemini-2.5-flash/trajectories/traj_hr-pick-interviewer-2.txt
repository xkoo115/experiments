Returns a JSON object with `execution_status`, `returncode`, `stdout`, and `stderr`. **Important Precautions**: 1) `returncode=0` does not guarantee successful side effects (e.g., file creation); always verify with independent checks (`ls -l`, `file`). 2) **This tool executes commands in a *minimal* shell environment. Complex shell features like command chaining (`&&`, `||`), pipes (`|`), I/O redirection (`>`, `>>`), and backgrounding (`&`) are often *not reliably interpreted by `run_cmd` directly* and can lead to unexpected behavior or errors (e.g., `SyntaxError`, `command not found`). For any non-trivial shell interaction or complex logic, *always prefer consolidating operations into a single Python script that uses `subprocess` for explicit control and robustness* over multiple `run_cmd` calls or complex shell syntax.** 3) Quote arguments containing spaces (`\"path with spaces\"`). 4) State changes (`cd`) do not persist across calls.", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"command": {"type": "string", "description": "shell command string."}}, "required": ["command"]}}}
</tools>

2. **Python Code Execution**
When executing Python code, please output:
<code>
... your code ...
</code>
- The working directory is `/workspace`
- Executing dangerous, destructive, or time-consuming code is prohibited.
- If both a **Tool Call** and **Python Code Execution** are included in the output, the tool call takes precedence, and the Python code will not be executed.
- Using outdated or limited python libraries may result in incomplete or inaccurate observations (e.g. missing images from PDFs or failing to extract key content). Always prefer robust, modern libraries to ensure full and reliable results.
- When performing file conversion or data extraction, always ensure **data integrity**. Verify that the structure, content, and critical fields of the source file are preserved in the output. Check row and column counts, headers, and key values before and after processing. **Avoid silent loss**, truncation, or unintended alteration of data.

## Action Execution Result Processing
- After each action is executed, an Observation is returned, which includes:
    1. `<tool_response>`: The result of the tool or code execution.
    2. `<tool_instruction>`: The instruction associated with a specific action, used to guide the next step or restrict subsequent behavior.
- **Note**: Do not fabricate observations.

## Security and Restrictions
- **Coding Actions (such as Python, CMD, etc.)**
    - Do not run high-risk operations that are large in code size or take a long time.
    - Do not execute code that could cause data loss, system damage, or irreversible changes.
    - Do not use the kill command with wildcards like * or other dangerous parameters that could result in a wide range of matches.
    - Prefer using the Python interpreter to execute code (safer and more efficient) rather than using the CMD tool.

> ⚠️ **Important**
> When your output contains content that fully conforms to the **Tool Call** or **Python Code Execution** format, the system will immediately parse, identify, and execute it as an **Action** without further confirmation and without reversal.
> Therefore, before outputting, always confirm that this is your **intended** action and fully assess the potential consequences and risks.
> If you are only using **quotes, demonstrations, or examples**, be sure to break the formatting or escape it to prevent the system from interpreting it as a real action.

# OBJECTIVE #
Your core objective is to independently and efficiently complete the tasks assigned to you by the company.


# MEMORY #
During previous tasks, you have accumulated the following reusable knowledge:

## Resolution Patterns
Comprehensive Contextualization: Systematically acquire and aggregate information from diverse, potentially unstructured sources, prioritizing local processing and cross-validation, to ensure a complete, coherent operational view and inform robust decisions.
Robust External Interaction: Prioritize stable, predictable interaction methods, such as structured APIs, and dynamically adapt strategies to ensure continuity and reliability with external systems despite their inconsistencies or volatility.
Adaptive Constraint Handling: When an objective is blocked by an unresolvable external constraint, acknowledge the limitation, perform necessary cleanup of partial artifacts, and adapt the strategy to proceed with viable data, avoiding unproductive retries.
Modular Resilient Design: Decompose operations into modular, decoupled units with explicit state management, to enhance predictability, isolate errors, improve maintainability, and ensure operational continuity.
Progressive Verification: Implement multi-stage validation, from granular checks within pipelines to comprehensive outcome validation, to localize errors, confirm system states, and ensure successful execution.

## Platform/Application Operation Guides
These guides summarize proven operation paths derived from past successful experiences.  
Each item is a structured reference designed to help you complete operations more quickly, accurately, and with reduced redundancy.

> This directory provides a comprehensive index of guides, compiling best practices and experience summaries for accomplishing various tasks.

### Recommended Usage Process
1. **Review the Guide First**  
   Before starting a task, browse the relevant entries in the directory to identify potentially useful guidance.  
2. **Targeted Access**  
   Use the `access_the_application_guide` tool to view detailed steps if necessary.  
3. **Reuse with Flexibility**  
   Apply past successful steps when they fit the current situation, but stay aware of possible mismatches.  
4. **Explore When Deviations Arise**  
   If the environment or results diverge from the guide, stop rigidly following it and explore alternative approaches through small, safe, and adaptive steps.

### Value of Guides
- Reduce task completion time by leveraging accumulated experience.  
- Lower error rates and avoid common pitfalls.  
- Ensure consistent, professional execution of tasks.  

### Guide Reliability & Adaptation
- Guides may be outdated, biased, or contain errors — they are “historical experience,” not absolute truth.  
- Use guides as starting points, not as strict rules.  
- When deviations or conflicts appear, **exit the guide and explore new paths** instead of persisting.  
- Record useful deviation points for later improvement of the guides.

Title: Subtask 1 Completion Verification Report - Rocketchat Login

Checklist Details:
- **Verify_login_status**: The `browser_wait_and_get_update` action confirmed that the current page displays the Rocketchat dashboard. The `webpage accessibility tree` and `webpage interactive elements` contain post-login dashboard features such as "Home", "Search", "Directory", "Display", "Create new", and "Administration" buttons, as well as direct message links like "mike_chen" and "chen_xinyi". Crucially, no login form elements (username/password input fields, login button) were present. This directly corroborates the Task Agent's observation in step 11 of the execution trajectory, where similar dashboard elements were identified, and login elements were absent, indicating a successful login.

Conclusion:
The Subtask "Login to Rocketchat" has been successfully completed by the Task Agent. The login process was verified through proactive inspection of the browser's current state, confirming the presence of expected post-login UI elements and the absence of login form components.

Title: Subtask 2 Completion Verification Report - Access Chen Xinyi's Direct Message

Checklist Details:
-   **Verify_current_url**: The `browser_wait_and_get_update` action in step 07 of the Task Agent's trajectory showed the browser's current URL as `http://the-agent-company.com:3000/direct/CZYWHd5bCmhj5YcFec2uqaen3naCexvzDE`. This URL precisely matches the expected direct message URL for Chen Xinyi, confirming successful navigation to her chat.
-   **Verify_chat_title**: The `webpage accessibility tree` in step 07 explicitly contained `heading 'chen_xinyi', level=1` within the `main 'Channel'` section.

Title: Subtask 3 Completion Verification Report - Ask Chen Xinyi for Interviewer List

Checklist Details:
- **verify_message_sent_content**: The `webpage accessibility tree` in Observation 09, following the `browser_send_keys` action, explicitly contains a `paragraph` element with the text "Hi Chen Xinyi, could you please provide a list of available interviewers for a candidate?". This entry is accompanied by the sender's username ("theagentcompany") and a timestamp, confirming that the message was successfully sent and is visible in the chat history.
- **verify_message_input_field_cleared**: After the message was sent, the `webpage accessibility tree` in Observation 09 shows the `textbox 'Message'` without the previously input text. Similarly, the corresponding `textarea` element (index 66) in the `webpage interactive elements` lacks any textual content, indicating that the message input field was successfully cleared, as expected after message submission.

SubTask5: Access Mark Johnson's Direct Message
Goal: Successfully navigate the browser to Mark Johnson's direct message conversation in Rocketchat.
57. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================
Thought: I need to navigate to Mark Johnson's direct message conversation. I will use the "AccessConversation" guide for RocketChat, which I have already accessed. The guide suggests that if the conversation link is clearly visible in the sidebar, directly clicking it is the most robust method. Since I'm currently in Chen Xinyi's chat, I should first go back to the home page or a page where the sidebar is visible, then locate Mark Johnson. However, the guide also states that if the direct link is not available, I can use the search functionality. I will try to go back to the home page first, then look for Mark Johnson. If I can't find him, I will use the search function.

First, I will go back to the RocketChat home page to ensure the sidebar is visible and I can easily find Mark Johnson.

Title: Subtask 5 Completion Verification Report - Access Mark Johnson's Direct Message

Checklist Details:
- **Verify_current_url**: The `browser_go_to_url` action and subsequent `webpage accessibility tree` in Observation 09 showed the browser's current URL as `http://the-agent-company.com:3000/direct/CZYWHd5bCmhj5YcFeRGZyENbrjkxjosMCH`. This URL precisely matches the expected direct message URL for Mark Johnson, confirming successful navigation to his chat.
- **Verify_chat_title**: The `webpage accessibility tree` in Observation 09 explicitly contained `heading 'mark_johnson', level=1` within the `main 'Channel'` section. This indicates that 'mark_johnson' is prominently displayed as the primary title of the current page, affirming that the correct direct message conversation is open and active.

Conclusion:
The Subtask "Access Mark Johnson's Direct Message" has been successfully completed by the Task Agent. Both the current URL and the page's main heading confirm that the browser is positioned within Mark Johnson's direct message conversation.

SubTask8: Access Jessica Lee's Direct Message
Goal: Successfully navigate the browser to Jessica Lee's direct message conversation in Rocketchat.
95. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================
Thought: I need to navigate to Jessica Lee's direct message conversation. I will use the "AccessConversation" guide for RocketChat, which I have already accessed. The guide suggests that if the conversation link is clearly visible in the sidebar, directly clicking it is the most robust method. Since I'm currently in Mark Johnson's chat, I should first go back to the home page or a page where the sidebar is visible, then locate Jessica Lee. However, the guide also states that if the direct link is not available, I can use the search functionality. I will try to go back to the home page first, then look for Jessica Lee. If I can't find her, I will use the search function.

First, I will go back to the RocketChat home page to ensure the sidebar is visible and I can easily find Jessica Lee.

Title: Subtask 8 Completion Verification Report - Access Jessica Lee's Direct Message

Checklist Details:
-   **Verify_current_url**: The `webpage accessibility tree` in Observation 09 shows the browser's current URL as `http://the-agent-company.com:3000/direct/4qnpxztMbfyYn3rQACZYWHd5bCmhj5YcFe`. Although this URL is a system-generated identifier, not the human-readable slug from the search results, the presence of `heading 'jessica_lee'` on the page confirms that this URL corresponds to Jessica Lee's direct message conversation.
-   **Verify_chat_title**: The `webpage accessibility tree` in Observation 09 explicitly contained `heading 'jessica_lee', level=1` within the `main 'Channel'` section. This indicates that 'jessica_lee' is prominently displayed as the primary title of the current page, affirming that the correct direct message conversation is open and active.

Conclusion:
The Subtask "Access Jessica Lee's Direct Message" has been successfully completed by the Task Agent. Both the current URL (despite its internal format) and the page's main heading confirm that the browser is positioned within Jessica Lee's direct message conversation.

<webpage accessibility tree>[SYSTEM INFO: History accessibility tree removed for brevity]</webpage accessibility tree>
<webpage interactive elements>[SYSTEM INFO: History interactive elements removed for brevity]</webpage interactive elements>

</tool_response>
<tool_instruction>
Always inspect the `webpage accessibility tree` and `webpage interactive elements` after navigation to confirm the page loaded as expected. This step is crucial for verifying successful navigation and for preparing for subsequent interactions by ensuring the browser state is as anticipated.
</tool_instruction>

133. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================
Thought: I have successfully navigated back to the RocketChat home page. I need to access Emily Zhou's direct message. I don't see "emily_zhou" listed in the direct messages in the sidebar. Therefore, I will use the search functionality. I will click the "Search" button, which has index 5.
Action:
<tool_call>
{"name": "browser_click", "arguments": {"index": 5}}
</tool_call>
134. | ================================================== USER MESSAGE ==================================================
Observation: 
<tool_response>
Performed browser action: Clicked button with index 5: 
The updated browser page status is as follows:

<webpage interactive elements>[SYSTEM INFO: History interactive elements removed for brevity]</webpage interactive elements>

</tool_response>
<tool_instruction>
If an `Element index does not exist` error is returned, it indicates extreme element volatility. **Always re-evaluate `webpage interactive elements` with `browser_wait_and_get_update` immediately before attempting a click, and crucially, confirm the element's `text` or `aria-label` attribute semantically matches the intended target.** If direct clicking by index proves unreliable, *especially within dynamic lists or sidebars (e.g., chat contact lists)*, consider alternative strategies like using an application's built-in search functionality or `browser_go_to_url` if a direct link is known, rather than repeatedly retrying. For form submissions or general action triggers, `browser_send_keys` with 'Enter' is a more robust alternative and **highly recommended for reliability**.
</tool_instruction>

135. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================
Thought: I have successfully clicked the "Search" button, and a search input field (index 4) is now visible. I will input "Emily Zhou" into this field to search for her direct message.

<webpage interactive elements>[SYSTEM INFO: History interactive elements removed for brevity]</webpage interactive elements>

</tool_response>
<tool_instruction>
After inputting text, always use `browser_wait_and_get_update` to verify the text input, check for immediate validation feedback, or confirm any UI changes (e.g., enable/disable buttons, form submission readiness). Be especially mindful of index volatility, as UI changes can rapidly invalidate previously retrieved indices.

Title: Subtask 11 Completion Verification Report - Access Emily Zhou's Direct Message

Checklist Details:
-   **Verify_current_url**: The `webpage accessibility tree` in Observation 09 shows the browser's current URL as `http://the-agent-company.com:3000/direct/CZYWHd5bCmhj5YcFeppuM42XhPD79wwxMv`. Although this URL is a system-generated identifier, the presence of `heading 'emily_zhou', level=1` on the page explicitly confirms that this URL corresponds to Emily Zhou's direct message conversation.
-   **Verify_chat_title**: The `webpage accessibility tree` in Observation 09 explicitly contained `heading 'emily_zhou', level=1` within the `main 'Channel'` section. This indicates that 'emily_zhou' is prominently displayed as the primary title of the current page, affirming that the correct direct message conversation is open and active.

Conclusion:
The Subtask "Access Emily Zhou's Direct Message" has been successfully completed by the Task Agent. Both the current URL (contextually verified by page content) and the page's main heading confirm that the browser is positioned within Emily Zhou's direct message conversation.

Always check `command_result.returncode`: `0` indicates success; non-zero suggests an error; analyze `command_result.stderr`. For successful commands, process `command_result.stdout`. *Note: `command_result.stderr` may contain non-error information; evaluate contextually.* **Crucially, for any sequence of shell commands or when integrating shell output with Python logic, *always encapsulate the entire interaction within a single Python script using `subprocess`* for maximum robustness and control, rather than relying on discrete `run_cmd` calls or shell features like redirection.**

Title: Subtask 14 Completion Verification Report - Write Emily Zhou's Name to File

Checklist Details:
-   **Verify_file_content**: The `run_cmd` action executed by the Task Agent in step 06 (`cat /workspace/interviewer.txt`) yielded `stdout: "Emily Zhou"` in Observation 07. This confirms that the content "Emily Zhou" was successfully written to the file `/workspace/interviewer.txt`, precisely matching the subtask goal.
-   **Verify_file_existence_and_permissions**: A proactive `run_cmd` action (`ls -l /workspace/interviewer.txt`) was executed, resulting in a `returncode: 0` and `stdout: "-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 10 Sep 15 11:36 /workspace/interviewer.txt"`. This output confirms the file `/workspace/interviewer.txt` exists, has appropriate permissions, and was successfully created/modified, indicating no system-level errors during the file operation.

Conclusion:
The Subtask "Write Emily Zhou's Name to File" has been successfully completed by the Task Agent. The content of the file and its existence have been verified, confirming that 'Emily Zhou' was correctly written to `/workspace/interviewer.txt`.

Title: Subtask 15 Completion Verification Report - Logout Rocketchat

Checklist Details:
-   **verify_current_page_is_login**: The `webpage accessibility tree` in Observation 23 shows that the current page, despite having the URL `http://the-agent-company.com:3000/home`, prominently displays login form elements such as textboxes for "Email or username" and "Password," and a "Login" button. This confirms that the browser is indeed on a page requiring login, indicating a logged-out state.
-   **verify_login_form_elements_present**: The `webpage interactive elements` in Observation 23 explicitly lists the "Email or username" textbox (index 6), "Password" textbox (index 8), and the "Login" button (index 9). The clear presence of these elements verifies that the login form is fully available and visible on the current page.
-   **verify_absence_of_post_login_elements**: A comparison with previous observations (e.g., Observation 05, 09) reveals that the `webpage accessibility tree` in Observation 23 no longer contains typical post-login UI elements such as the 'Home', 'Search', 'Directory', 'Display', 'Create new', and 'Administration' buttons, nor the lists of channels and direct message links (e.g., 'emily_zhou', 'jessica_lee'). Their absence confirms that the user session has been terminated and the user is no longer logged in.

Conclusion:
The Subtask "Logout Rocketchat" has been successfully completed by the Task Agent. The presence of login form elements and the absence of post-login UI features on the current page confirm that the logout process was successful.
