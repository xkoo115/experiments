Returns a JSON object with `execution_status`, `returncode`, `stdout`, and `stderr`. **Important Precautions**: 1) `returncode=0` does not guarantee successful side effects (e.g., file creation); always verify with independent checks (`ls -l`, `file`). 2) **This tool executes commands in a *minimal* shell environment. Complex shell features like command chaining (`&&`, `||`), pipes (`|`), I/O redirection (`>`, `>>`), and backgrounding (`&`) are often *not reliably interpreted by `run_cmd` directly* and can lead to unexpected behavior or errors (e.g., `SyntaxError`, `command not found`). For any non-trivial shell interaction or complex logic, *always prefer consolidating operations into a single Python script that uses `subprocess` for explicit control and robustness* over multiple `run_cmd` calls or complex shell syntax.** 3) Quote arguments containing spaces (`\"path with spaces\"`). 4) State changes (`cd`) do not persist across calls.", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"command": {"type": "string", "description": "command暂时没有参数描述"}}, "required": ["command"]}}}
</tools>

2. **Python Code Execution**
When executing Python code, please output:
<code>
... your code ...
</code>
- The working directory is `/workspace`
- Executing dangerous, destructive, or time-consuming code is prohibited.
- If both a **Tool Call** and **Python Code Execution** are included in the output, the tool call takes precedence, and the Python code will not be executed.
- Using outdated or limited python libraries may result in incomplete or inaccurate observations (e.g. missing images from PDFs or failing to extract key content). Always prefer robust, modern libraries to ensure full and reliable results.
- When performing file conversion or data extraction, always ensure **data integrity**. Verify that the structure, content, and critical fields of the source file are preserved in the output. Check row and column counts, headers, and key values before and after processing. **Avoid silent loss**, truncation, or unintended alteration of data.

## Action Execution Result Processing
- After each action is executed, an Observation is returned, which includes:
    1. `<tool_response>`: The result of the tool or code execution.
    2. `<tool_instruction>`: The instruction associated with a specific action, used to guide the next step or restrict subsequent behavior.
- **Note**: Do not fabricate observations.

## Security and Restrictions
- **Coding Actions (such as Python, CMD, etc.)**
    - Do not run high-risk operations that are large in code size or take a long time.
    - Do not execute code that could cause data loss, system damage, or irreversible changes.
    - Do not use the kill command with wildcards like * or other dangerous parameters that could result in a wide range of matches.
    - Prefer using the Python interpreter to execute code (safer and more efficient) rather than using the CMD tool.

> ⚠️ **Important**
> When your output contains content that fully conforms to the **Tool Call** or **Python Code Execution** format, the system will immediately parse, identify, and execute it as an **Action** without further confirmation and without reversal.
> Therefore, before outputting, always confirm that this is your **intended** action and fully assess the potential consequences and risks.
> If you are only using **quotes, demonstrations, or examples**, be sure to break the formatting or escape it to prevent the system from interpreting it as a real action.

# OBJECTIVE #
Your core objective is to independently and efficiently complete the tasks assigned to you by the company.


# MEMORY #
During previous tasks, you have accumulated the following reusable knowledge:

## Resolution Patterns
Comprehensive Contextualization: Systematically acquire and aggregate information from diverse, potentially unstructured sources, prioritizing local processing and cross-validation, to ensure a complete, coherent operational view and inform robust decisions.
Robust External Interaction: Prioritize stable, predictable interaction methods, such as structured APIs, and dynamically adapt strategies to ensure continuity and reliability with external systems despite their inconsistencies or volatility.
Adaptive Constraint Handling: When an objective is blocked by an unresolvable external constraint, acknowledge the limitation, perform necessary cleanup of partial artifacts, and adapt the strategy to proceed with viable data, avoiding unproductive retries.
Modular Resilient Design: Decompose operations into modular, decoupled units with explicit state management, to enhance predictability, isolate errors, improve maintainability, and ensure operational continuity.
Progressive Verification: Implement multi-stage validation, from granular checks within pipelines to comprehensive outcome validation, to localize errors, confirm system states, and ensure successful execution.

## Platform/Application Operation Guides
These guides summarize proven operation paths derived from past successful experiences.  
Each item is a structured reference designed to help you complete operations more quickly, accurately, and with reduced redundancy.

> This directory provides a comprehensive index of guides, compiling best practices and experience summaries for accomplishing various tasks.

### Recommended Usage Process
1. **Review the Guide First**  
   Before starting a task, browse the relevant entries in the directory to identify potentially useful guidance.  
2. **Targeted Access**  
   Use the `access_the_application_guide` tool to view detailed steps if necessary.  
3. **Reuse with Flexibility**  
   Apply past successful steps when they fit the current situation, but stay aware of possible mismatches.  
4. **Explore When Deviations Arise**  
   If the environment or results diverge from the guide, stop rigidly following it and explore alternative approaches through small, safe, and adaptive steps.

### Value of Guides
- Reduce task completion time by leveraging accumulated experience.  
- Lower error rates and avoid common pitfalls.  
- Ensure consistent, professional execution of tasks.  

### Guide Reliability & Adaptation
- Guides may be outdated, biased, or contain errors — they are “historical experience,” not absolute truth.  
- Use guides as starting points, not as strict rules.  
- When deviations or conflicts appear, **exit the guide and explore new paths** instead of persisting.  
- Record useful deviation points for later improvement of the guides.

If an `Element index does not exist` error is returned, it indicates extreme element volatility. **Always re-evaluate `webpage interactive elements` with `browser_wait_and_get_update` immediately before attempting a click, and crucially, confirm the element's `text` or `aria-label` attribute semantically matches the intended target.** If direct clicking by index proves unreliable, *especially within dynamic lists or sidebars (e.g., chat contact lists)*, consider alternative strategies like using an application's built-in search functionality or `browser_go_to_url` if a direct link is known, rather than repeatedly retrying. For form submissions or general action triggers, `browser_send_keys` with 'Enter' is a more robust alternative and **highly recommended for reliability**.

Thought: I am currently on the `copilot-arena-server` repository page in GitLab. I need to find files that specify dependencies. I will use `browser_wait_and_get_update` to get the current page's interactive elements and accessibility tree to identify file listings. There is no specific guide for listing files within a GitLab repository, but `AnalyzePageContent` from the `Browser` guide could be helpful in interpreting the page. I will directly inspect the page content after `browser_wait_and_get_update()`.

SubTask4: UpdateMyenvTxtWithEarliestStableReleases
Goal: Modify the `myenv.txt` file by incorporating the extracted minimum version requirements, ensuring that each package is set to its earliest stable release that satisfies the specified minimum, and write the updated content back to `/workspace/myenv.txt`.
43. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================
Thought: I need to parse the current `myenv.txt` content and the extracted requirements, compare them, and then write the updated content back to `myenv.txt`. I will need the `System - WriteFile` guide. I will also need to process and format string data, which might be covered by `System - ProcessAndFormatStringData`.

Thought: I have the current `myenv.txt` content and the required minimum versions. I need to write a Python script to:
1. Parse both sets of requirements into dictionaries or similar structures.
2. Iterate through the required packages.
3. For each package, determine the version to use based on the "earliest stable release that satisfies the minimum version requirements" rule. In this context, this means using the exact minimum version specified (e.g., `fastapi>=0.111.0` becomes `fastapi==0.111.0`). For `apscheduler~=3.10.4`, it means `apscheduler==3.10.4`.
4. Construct the new `myenv.txt` content.
5. Write this new content to `/workspace/myenv.txt`.

I will use a Python script to perform these steps.

This directly fulfills the goal of modifying the file to incorporate the earliest stable releases that satisfy the minimum version requirements and writing it back to `/workspace/myenv.txt`.

Final Answer: The `myenv.txt` file has been successfully updated. The following modifications were made:
- `pandas` was updated from `1.4` to `1.5.3` to satisfy `pandas>=1.5.3`.
- `scikit-learn` was updated from `1.3` to `1.5.1` to satisfy `scikit-learn>=1.5.1`.

Final Answer:
**Report on `myenv.txt` Modifications for `copilot-arena-server` Environment**

To address potential library version issues for the `copilot-arena-server` environment, the `/workspace/myenv.txt` file has been updated to align with the minimum version requirements specified in the `copilot-arena-server`'s `requirements.txt` from the GitLab repository (`http://the-agent-company.com:8929/root/copilot-arena-server/-/blob/main/requirements.txt`).

The modifications were made following the principle of using the **earliest stable release that satisfies the minimum version requirements**.

**Summary of Changes:**

1.  **`pandas`**:
    *   **Previous Version in `myenv.txt`**: `1.4`
    *   **Required Minimum Version**: `pandas>=1.5.3`
    *   **New Version in `myenv.txt`**: `1.5.3`
    *   **Justification**: The original `pandas` version `1.4` did not meet the minimum requirement of `1.5.3`. The version was updated to `1.5.3`, which is the earliest stable release that satisfies this minimum requirement.

2.  **`scikit-learn`**:
    *   **Previous Version in `myenv.txt`**: `1.3`
    *   **Required Minimum Version**: `scikit-learn>=1.5.1`
    *   **New Version in `myenv.txt`**: `1.5.1`
    *   **Justification**: The original `scikit-learn` version `1.3` did not meet the minimum requirement of `1.5.1`. The version was updated to `1.5.1`, which is the earliest stable release that satisfies this minimum requirement.

**All other packages** in `myenv.txt` either already met their respective minimum version requirements or were updated to precisely match the specified minimum version (e.g., `package==X.Y.Z` for `package>=X.Y.Z` or `package~=X.Y.Z`).

**New `/workspace/myenv.txt` Content:**

```
PyYAML==6.0.1
amplitude-analytics==1.1.4
anthropic==0.31.2
apscheduler==3.10.4
cachetools==5.3.3
fastapi==0.111.0
firebase-admin==6.5.0
google-generativeai==0.7.2
groq==0.9.0
mistralai==1.0.0
openai==1.35.10
pandas==1.5.3
scikit-learn==1.5.1
slowapi==0.1.9
tiktoken==0.7.0
together==1.2.1
uvicorn==0.30.6
```

These changes ensure that the environment's installed libraries meet the minimum requirements for the `copilot-arena-server` as specified by its `requirements.txt` file, thereby mitigating potential version-related issues.

Title: Subtask Completion Report: Login to RocketChat

Checklist Details:
1.  **Verify_Successful_Navigation**: Verified. The Task Agent successfully navigated to the RocketChat login page.
    *   **Evidence**: The `tool_response` in step 05 explicitly states "Performed browser action: 🔗 Navigated to http://the-agent-company.com:3000/home". The `webpage accessibility tree` in the same observation also confirms `RootWebArea 'Rocket.Chat', focusable=True, focused=True, url='http://the-agent-company.com:3000/home'`, indicating the correct page title and URL.
2.  **Verify_Presence_of_Dashboard_Elements**: Verified. Elements indicative of a successful login to the RocketChat dashboard were observed.
    *   **Evidence**: The `webpage accessibility tree` in Observation 11 shows several dashboard elements, including "button 'Home'", "button 'Search'", "button 'Directory'", "button 'Administration'", and a "region 'Channels'" listing channels like 'general' and 'kudos'. These elements confirm the user is past the login screen and on the main application interface.
3.  **Verify_Absence_of_LoginForm_Elements**: Verified. The login form elements are no longer present on the page.
    *   **Evidence**: Comparing the `webpage interactive elements` from Observation 11 with those from Observation 05 (the login page), it is evident that the input fields for "Email or username" (index 6 in Obs 05), "Password" (index 8 in Obs 05), and the "Login" button (index 9 in Obs 05) are completely absent in Observation 11.

Conclusion:
The Task Agent has successfully completed the subtask. All verification steps confirm that the Task Agent successfully logged into the RocketChat platform, navigated to the dashboard, and the login form elements are no longer visible, indicating a complete and successful login process.

Thought: I have accessed the RocketChat guides. To identify a software engineer on the "webcrawler team," I need to search for either a channel named "webcrawler team" or individual users associated with such a team.

The `AccessConversation` guide suggests using the search functionality if a direct link is not available. The `AccessUserManagementPage` guide allows me to view all users, which might be helpful if I need to search for users by their team affiliation. However, I don't know if there's a direct way to filter users by "webcrawler team" on that page.

I will start by searching for a channel or direct message related to "webcrawler team" using the `AccessConversation` guide's search method. If that doesn't yield results, I might need to explore the user management page.

First, I need to make sure I am on the RocketChat home page and then use `browser_wait_and_get_update()` to get the current interactive elements.

If an `Element index does not exist` error is returned, it indicates extreme element volatility. **Always re-evaluate `webpage interactive elements` with `browser_wait_and_get_update` immediately before attempting a click, and crucially, confirm the element's `text` or `aria-label` attribute semantically matches the intended target.** If direct clicking by index proves unreliable, *especially within dynamic lists or sidebars (e.g., chat contact lists)*, consider alternative strategies like using an application's built-in search functionality or `browser_go_to_url` if a direct link is known, rather than repeatedly retrying. For form submissions or general action triggers, `browser_send_keys` with 'Enter' is a more robust alternative and **highly recommended for reliability**.

Thought: I previously tried clicking the "Directory" button (index 6) but it did not navigate to a directory page. I also tried searching for "webcrawler team" directly, which yielded no results.

Looking at the `webpage interactive elements` from the last observation, there is a button labeled "Open directory" at index 53. This seems like a more direct way to access a directory of users and channels. I will click this button.

Always remember that your ultimate goal is to complete task:
<task>
You previously set up an evironment to run the copilot-arena-server, the library installation config for your environment is in the 'myenv.txt' file, which is located in the /workspace folder. Your environment cannot successfully run experiments right now, possibly due to library version issues. You will need to find the requirements pages for the copilot-arena-server repo, which is in this gitlab http://the-agent-company.com:8929/, and modify 'myenv.txt' according to the requirement instructions. Ensure the modifications make use of the earliest stable release that satisfies the minimum version requirements. Further, spell out all your modifications to your current environment and the reasons, and send it to a software engineer on the webcrawler team using rocketchat, which can be found using this link http://the-agent-company.com:3000/, who is awaiting your results.

Please comprehensively review the entire task execution process, including all subtasks and the contextual information collected.  
Cross-check carefully against the overall task requirements:

1. **Completeness Check**: Ensure every aspect of the requirements has been addressed. Confirm that no items were skipped, postponed, or only partially completed.  
2. **Consistency Check**: Verify that all intermediate results are logically coherent and data-wise consistent with the final conclusions. There should be no contradictions, missing steps, or unexplained gaps.  
3. **Final Completion Confirmation**:  
   - If any requirements remain unfinished or results are insufficient, explicitly list the next subtasks to resolve them.  
   - If all requirements are fully and correctly met, return an empty task plan to indicate the task is completely finished.  

Always remember that your ultimate goal is to complete task:
<task>
You previously set up an evironment to run the copilot-arena-server, the library installation config for your environment is in the 'myenv.txt' file, which is located in the /workspace folder. Your environment cannot successfully run experiments right now, possibly due to library version issues. You will need to find the requirements pages for the copilot-arena-server repo, which is in this gitlab http://the-agent-company.com:8929/, and modify 'myenv.txt' according to the requirement instructions. Ensure the modifications make use of the earliest stable release that satisfies the minimum version requirements. Further, spell out all your modifications to your current environment and the reasons, and send it to a software engineer on the webcrawler team using rocketchat, which can be found using this link http://the-agent-company.com:3000/, who is awaiting your results.
