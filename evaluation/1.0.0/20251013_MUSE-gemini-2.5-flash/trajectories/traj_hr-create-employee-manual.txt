# ACTION #
During task execution, you can perform **Actions**, including:
1. **Tool Call**
2. **Python Code Execution**

## Action Output Format
1. **Tool Call**
When calling a tool, please output:
<tool_call>
{"name": "<function-name>", "arguments": <args-json-object>}
</tool_call>
- `<function-name>`: Tool function name
- `<args-json-object>`: Call arguments (JSON format)
- If multiple `<tool_call>` are output at once, only the first one will be executed; the rest will be ignored.

Available tool signatures are provided within the `<tools>` tag:
<tools>
{"type": "function", "function": {"name": "extract_image_content_by_gpt4o", "description": "Utilizes `gpt-4o` to interpret and extract content from local image files (e.g., PNG, JPEG). Highly effective for **scanned documents, image-based PDFs (post-conversion to image formats),** or visual data. For optimal extraction, craft precise queries. **Caution: While effective for general content, direct numerical or highly structured extraction from complex visual elements (e.g., tally marks, handwritten notes) may be imprecise; robust post-processing is often required. For multi-page documents, convert each page into a separate image and ensure *all* generated image pages are processed for complete data extraction.**", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"image_path": {"type": "string", "description": "Local image path."}, "query": {"type": "string", "description": "Query to the gpt-4o to get the image content."}}, "required": ["image_path", "query"]}}}

Element indices are dynamic and highly volatile; always verify the target element's existence and index using `browser_wait_and_get_update` immediately before clicking. Be aware that even with immediate updates, indices can shift in very dynamic UIs. Crucially, after clicking, always use `browser_wait_and_get_update` to immediately re-evaluate the page state and confirm the intended effect (e.g., UI changes, navigation). For navigation, `browser_go_to_url` is a more robust alternative when a direct URL is known. For form submissions or general action triggers, `browser_send_keys` with 'Enter' is often a more robust alternative, especially when direct clicking by index proves unreliable. Avoid clicking elements that are not currently visible or interactable.", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"index": {"type": "integer", "description": "The index number of the target element."}}, "required": ["index"]}}}

It cannot process content that is scrolled out of view or exists on other pages of a paginated list. While `accessibility tree` and `interactive elements` are primary for UI understanding, this visual tool can be a highly effective *primary* method for text extraction in challenging scenarios. **Crucially, for critical or structured data (e.g., IDs, specific names, numerical values), always cross-verify with or prefer extraction from the `webpage accessibility tree` as visual interpretation may introduce inaccuracies, especially for abbreviated or visually ambiguous elements.**", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"query": {"type": "string", "description": "Query to the VL model to get the browser page content."}}, "required": ["query"]}}}

The `webpage interactive elements` from its output are highly dynamic and should be used immediately. For verifying responses or dynamic updates, consider setting `seconds` to a value appropriate for expected latency (e.g., `seconds=1` for immediate state, longer for human-like response times). **This tool is a fundamental prerequisite for almost all subsequent browser interactions due to the highly dynamic nature of web UI element indices.**", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"seconds": {"type": "integer", "description": "The number of seconds to wait, the default is 3 seconds.", "default": 3}}, "required": []}}}

Complex shell features like command chaining (`&&`, `||`), pipes (`|`), I/O redirection (`>`, `>>`), and backgrounding (`&`) are often *not reliably interpreted by `run_cmd` directly* and can lead to unexpected behavior or errors (e.g., `SyntaxError`, `command not found`). For any non-trivial shell interaction or complex logic, *always prefer consolidating operations into a single Python script that uses `subprocess` for explicit control and robustness* over multiple `run_cmd` calls or complex shell syntax.** 3) Quote arguments containing spaces (`\"path with spaces\"`). 4) State changes (`cd`) do not persist across calls.", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"command": {"type": "string", "description": "command暂时没有参数描述"}}, "required": ["command"]}}}
</tools>

2. **Python Code Execution**
When executing Python code, please output:
<code>
... your code ...
</code>
- The working directory is `/workspace`
- Executing dangerous, destructive, or time-consuming code is prohibited.
- If both a **Tool Call** and **Python Code Execution** are included in the output, the tool call takes precedence, and the Python code will not be executed.
- Using outdated or limited python libraries may result in incomplete or inaccurate observations (e.g. missing images from PDFs or failing to extract key content). Always prefer robust, modern libraries to ensure full and reliable results.
- When performing file conversion or data extraction, always ensure **data integrity**. Verify that the structure, content, and critical fields of the source file are preserved in the output. Check row and column counts, headers, and key values before and after processing. **Avoid silent loss**, truncation, or unintended alteration of data.

## Action Execution Result Processing
- After each action is executed, an Observation is returned, which includes:
    1. `<tool_response>`: The result of the tool or code execution.
    2. `<tool_instruction>`: The instruction associated with a specific action, used to guide the next step or restrict subsequent behavior.
- **Note**: Do not fabricate observations.

## Security and Restrictions
- **Coding Actions (such as Python, CMD, etc.)**
    - Do not run high-risk operations that are large in code size or take a long time.
    - Do not execute code that could cause data loss, system damage, or irreversible changes.
    - Do not use the kill command with wildcards like * or other dangerous parameters that could result in a wide range of matches.
    - Prefer using the Python interpreter to execute code (safer and more efficient) rather than using the CMD tool.

> ⚠️ **Important**
> When your output contains content that fully conforms to the **Tool Call** or **Python Code Execution** format, the system will immediately parse, identify, and execute it as an **Action** without further confirmation and without reversal.
> Therefore, before outputting, always confirm that this is your **intended** action and fully assess the potential consequences and risks.
> If you are only using **quotes, demonstrations, or examples**, be sure to break the formatting or escape it to prevent the system from interpreting it as a real action.

# OBJECTIVE #
Your core objective is to independently and efficiently complete the tasks assigned to you by the company.


# MEMORY #
During previous tasks, you have accumulated the following reusable knowledge:

## Resolution Patterns
Comprehensive Contextualization: Systematically acquire and aggregate information from diverse, potentially unstructured sources, prioritizing local processing and cross-validation, to ensure a complete, coherent operational view and inform robust decisions.
Robust External Interaction: Prioritize stable, predictable interaction methods, such as structured APIs, and dynamically adapt strategies to ensure continuity and reliability with external systems despite their inconsistencies or volatility.
Adaptive Constraint Handling: When an objective is blocked by an unresolvable external constraint, acknowledge the limitation, perform necessary cleanup of partial artifacts, and adapt the strategy to proceed with viable data, avoiding unproductive retries.
Modular Resilient Design: Decompose operations into modular, decoupled units with explicit state management, to enhance predictability, isolate errors, improve maintainability, and ensure operational continuity.
Progressive Verification: Implement multi-stage validation, from granular checks within pipelines to comprehensive outcome validation, to localize errors, confirm system states, and ensure successful execution.

## Platform/Application Operation Guides
These guides summarize proven operation paths derived from past successful experiences.  
Each item is a structured reference designed to help you complete operations more quickly, accurately, and with reduced redundancy.

> This directory provides a comprehensive index of guides, compiling best practices and experience summaries for accomplishing various tasks.

### Recommended Usage Process
1. **Review the Guide First**  
   Before starting a task, browse the relevant entries in the directory to identify potentially useful guidance.  
2. **Targeted Access**  
   Use the `access_the_application_guide` tool to view detailed steps if necessary.  
3. **Reuse with Flexibility**  
   Apply past successful steps when they fit the current situation, but stay aware of possible mismatches.  
4. **Explore When Deviations Arise**  
   If the environment or results diverge from the guide, stop rigidly following it and explore alternative approaches through small, safe, and adaptive steps.

### Value of Guides
- Reduce task completion time by leveraging accumulated experience.  
- Lower error rates and avoid common pitfalls.  
- Ensure consistent, professional execution of tasks.  

### Guide Reliability & Adaptation
- Guides may be outdated, biased, or contain errors — they are “historical experience,” not absolute truth.  
- Use guides as starting points, not as strict rules.  
- When deviations or conflicts appear, **exit the guide and explore new paths** instead of persisting.  
- Record useful deviation points for later improvement of the guides.

Title: SubTask1 Completion Verification Report: login_to_owncloud

Checklist Details:
1.  **`verify_current_url`**: The browser's current URL, as observed in the Task Agent's trajectory at steps 11 and 13, is `http://the-agent-company.com:8092/index.php/apps/files/?dir=%2F&fileid=5`. This URL clearly indicates that the browser is successfully logged into ownCloud's file management interface.
2.  **`verify_logged_in_elements`**: The `webpage accessibility tree` and `webpage interactive elements` in the Task Agent's Observation 13 confirm the presence of the 'Files' heading, 'Documents' folder, and the 'theagentcompany' username. Additionally, a comparison with Observation 5 (login page) shows the clear absence of username and password input fields, and the login button in Observation 13.

Thought: I have accessed the `NavigateDirectory` guide for OwnCloud. It suggests prioritizing direct URL navigation. The target directory is `Documents`. The current URL is `http://the-agent-company.com:8092/index.php/apps/files/?dir=%2F&fileid=5`. I can construct a direct URL to the `Documents` folder. The guide mentions URL encoding `/` as `%2F`. So, `Documents` would be `Documents`.
The direct URL would be `http://the-agent-company.com:8092/index.php/apps/files/?dir=%2FDocuments`.

Alternatively, I can click on the "Documents" link if it's present on the current page. I will first use `browser_wait_and_get_update()` to get the current interactive elements and then decide whether to use direct URL or click.

Title: SubTask2 Completion Verification Report: navigate_to_documents_folder

Checklist Details:
1.  **`verify_url_update`**: The browser's URL, as observed in the Task Agent's trajectory at <reference_content>Observation 07</reference_content> (`http://the-agent-company.com:8092/index.php/apps/files/?dir=%2F&fileid=5`), has not been updated to reflect navigation into the 'Documents' folder. The `dir` parameter remains `%2F`, indicating the root directory, not a path to 'Documents'.
2.  **`verify_documents_folder_content_display`**: The main content area of the page, visible in <reference_content>Observation 07</reference_content>, continues to display the 'Documents' folder itself as an item in the file listing. This indicates that the browser is still in the parent directory (root) and has not successfully navigated *into* the 'Documents' folder to display its internal contents. The file listing is identical to that in <reference_content>Observation 05</reference_content> (before the click).
3.  **`verify_breadcrumb_navigation_path`**: While the `<webpage accessibility tree>` in <reference_content>Observation 07</reference_content> shows a breadcrumb-like structure with 'Home' followed by a `heading 'Documents'`, this visual element alone does not confirm successful navigation. The discrepancy with the URL and the actual displayed file contents indicates this is likely a UI representation rather than a true change in the navigated directory.

Conclusion: SubTask2: navigate_to_documents_folder is **not complete**. Despite clicking the 'Documents' link, the browser's URL and the displayed file contents clearly indicate that the agent has not successfully navigated into the 'Documents' folder. The page remains in the root directory.

31. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================
* The current Subtask still has the following issues:
    1. The previous `browser_click(index=5)` did not successfully navigate into the 'Documents' folder; the URL parameter `dir` still points to the root, and the displayed content remains the same as the parent directory.
    2. The interactive element at index 5, although labeled 'Documents', did not trigger the expected folder navigation, indicating a potential issue with targeting the correct interactive element for folder entry or a UI behavior that differs from a simple click.

* Consider trying the following actions:
    1. Perform `browser_wait_and_get_update()` to get the freshest interactive elements and accessibility tree to identify the correct element (e.g., an icon, a different part of the link, or a specific "Open" button) that triggers navigation into the 'Documents' folder.
    2. If direct clicking on an element continues to be problematic, attempt to construct a direct URL to the 'Documents' folder (e.g., `http://the-agent-company.com:8092/index.php/apps/files/?dir=/Documents`) and use `browser_go_to_url` for navigation.

Checklist Details:
1.  **`verify_file_existence`**: The `ls -l TAC_overview.md` command executed in the check plan (Observation 10) returned a `returncode` of `0` and `stdout` showing `-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 1388 Dec 10 2024 TAC_overview.md`. This confirms that the file `TAC_overview.md` exists in the current working directory, which is the local workspace.
2.  **`verify_file_size`**: The `stdout` from the `ls -l TAC_overview.md` command (Observation 10) explicitly shows the file size as `1388` bytes. This is consistent with the reported download size of `1388` bytes in the Task Agent's `wget` command `stderr` (Observation 07: "Length: 1388 (1.4K) [text/markdown]"). This confirms that the downloaded file is not empty or corrupted in terms of size.

Conclusion: SubTask3: `download_tac_overview_md` is complete. The `TAC_overview.md` file has been successfully downloaded to the local workspace with the correct size.

Checklist Details:
1.  **`verify_file_content_extracted`**: The content extracted by the Task Agent from `TAC_overview.md`, as shown in `stdout` from Observation 05, was identical to the content retrieved by an independent `cat TAC_overview.md` command performed during this verification (Observation in CheckStep 1). This confirms that the extracted content is complete and accurate.
2.  **`verify_readiness_for_structuring`**: The extracted content is available as a plain text string in the `stdout` from `run_cmd` (Observation 05). This format is universally suitable for subsequent processing and structuring, as also acknowledged by the Task Agent in its final thought (Observation 06), stating it's "available as a string and can be used in the next step to draft the employee manual."

Title: SubTask6 Completion Verification Report: convert_draft_to_odt

Checklist Details:
1.  **`verify_odt_file_existence`**: The `ls -l Employee_Manual.odt` command executed in the check plan returned a `returncode` of `0` and `stdout` showing `-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 10468 Sep 12 19:53 Employee_Manual.odt`. This confirms that the file `Employee_Manual.odt` exists in the local workspace.
2.  **`verify_odt_file_type_and_size`**: The `file Employee_Manual.odt` command executed in the check plan returned `stdout` as `Employee_Manual.odt: OpenDocument Text`. This explicitly verifies that the created file is an OpenDocument Text (ODT) document. The size of `10468` bytes, as confirmed by the `ls -l` command, indicates that the file contains content and is not empty or corrupted.

Conclusion: SubTask6: `convert_draft_to_odt` is complete. The drafted employee manual content has been successfully converted into the required 'Employee_Manual.odt' file format, and the resulting file is correctly identified as an ODT document with a reasonable size.

SubTask7: ensure_hr_team_folder_exists
Goal: The 'Documents/Human Resources Team' folder is confirmed to exist within ownCloud, or is created if absent, and is accessible for file upload.
89. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================
Thought: I need to ensure the `Documents/Human Resources Team` folder exists within ownCloud. If it doesn't, I need to create it. I'll start by checking if the folder exists. I will use `OwnCloud: NavigateDirectory` to ensure I'm in the `Documents` folder (which I am, but it's good to confirm), and then I'll look for a way to check for the existence of "Human Resources Team". There isn't a direct "Create Folder" guide, so I'll need to figure that out if the folder doesn't exist. I'll also check `OwnCloud: SystematicWebDAVFileSearch` as it might provide a programmatic way to check for folder existence.

Helpful guides:
- `OwnCloud: NavigateDirectory`
- `OwnCloud: SearchForFile`
- `OwnCloud: SystematicWebDAVFileSearch`
- `OwnCloud: UploadFileWebDAV` (might give hints on WebDAV folder creation)

Always check `command_result.returncode`: `0` indicates success; non-zero suggests an error; analyze `command_result.stderr`. For successful commands, process `command_result.stdout`. *Note: `command_result.stderr` may contain non-error information; evaluate contextually.* **Crucially, for any sequence of shell commands or when integrating shell output with Python logic, *always encapsulate the entire interaction within a single Python script using `subprocess`* for maximum robustness and control, rather than relying on discrete `run_cmd` calls or shell features like redirection.**

Thought: I have executed the `PROPFIND` command and analyzed the `stdout`. I found a `<d:response>` block containing `<d:href>/remote.php/webdav/Documents/Human%20Resources%20Team/</d:href>` and `<d:resourcetype><d:collection/></d:resourcetype>`. This clearly indicates that the 'Human Resources Team' folder already exists within the 'Documents' folder on ownCloud. Therefore, the goal of ensuring the folder exists (or creating it if absent) has been met.
Final Answer: The 'Documents/Human Resources Team' folder is confirmed to exist within ownCloud.

Title: SubTask7 Completion Verification Report: ensure_hr_team_folder_exists

Checklist Details:
1.  **`verify_folder_presence_in_propfind_xml`**: The XML output from the `PROPFIND` command in Observation 05 was programmatically parsed. The parsing confirmed the presence of a `<d:response>` element that explicitly contained both the `<d:href>` tag with the value `/remote.php/webdav/Documents/Human%20Resources%20Team/` and a `<d:resourcetype><d:collection/></d:resourcetype>` tag within its `propstat`. This definitively indicates that the 'Human Resources Team' folder exists in ownCloud and is indeed recognized as a collection (directory). This finding directly supports and validates the Task Agent's conclusion in Observation 06.

Conclusion: SubTask7: `ensure_hr_team_folder_exists` is complete. The 'Documents/Human Resources Team' folder has been confirmed to exist within ownCloud.

Title: SubTask8 Completion Verification Report: upload_employee_manual_odt

Checklist Details:
1.  **`verify_remote_file_presence_via_propfind`**: The `PROPFIND` command executed in CheckStep 1 (Observation 01) returned a `returncode` of `0` and its `stdout` contained XML. A subsequent Python script parsed this XML (Observation 02) and successfully identified an entry for `Employee_Manual.odt` with the href `/remote.php/webdav/Documents/Human%20Resources%20Team/Employee_Manual.odt`. This confirms the file's presence on ownCloud via WebDAV.
2.  **`verify_remote_file_presence_via_ui`**: Navigating to `http://the-agent-company.com:8092/index.php/apps/files?dir=%2FDocuments%2FHuman%20Resources%20Team` in CheckStep 2 (Observation 03) revealed the ownCloud file listing page. The `webpage accessibility tree` clearly showed a link labeled "Employee_Manual .odt" with the associated URL `/remote.php/webdav/Documents/Human%20Resources%20Team/Employee_Manual.odt`, explicitly confirming its visual presence and accessibility within the ownCloud UI.

Conclusion: SubTask8: `upload_employee_manual_odt` is complete. The 'Employee_Manual.odt' file has been successfully uploaded to the 'Documents/Human Resources Team' folder on ownCloud, as verified by both WebDAV `PROPFIND` and direct UI inspection.
