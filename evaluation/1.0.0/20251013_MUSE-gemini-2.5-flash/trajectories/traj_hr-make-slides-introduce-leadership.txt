# ACTION #
During task execution, you can perform **Actions**, including:
1. **Tool Call**
2. **Python Code Execution**

## Action Output Format
1. **Tool Call**
When calling a tool, please output:
<tool_call>
{"name": "<function-name>", "arguments": <args-json-object>}
</tool_call>
- `<function-name>`: Tool function name
- `<args-json-object>`: Call arguments (JSON format)
- If multiple `<tool_call>` are output at once, only the first one will be executed; the rest will be ignored.

Available tool signatures are provided within the `<tools>` tag:
<tools>
{"type": "function", "function": {"name": "extract_image_content_by_gpt4o", "description": "Utilizes `gpt-4o` to interpret and extract content from local image files (e.g., PNG, JPEG). Highly effective for **scanned documents, image-based PDFs (post-conversion to image formats),** or visual data. For optimal extraction, craft precise queries. **Caution: While effective for general content, direct numerical or highly structured extraction from complex visual elements (e.g., tally marks, handwritten notes) may be imprecise; robust post-processing is often required.

Element indices are dynamic and highly volatile; always verify the target element's existence and index using `browser_wait_and_get_update` immediately before clicking. Be aware that even with immediate updates, indices can shift in very dynamic UIs. Crucially, after clicking, always use `browser_wait_and_get_update` to immediately re-evaluate the page state and confirm the intended effect (e.g., UI changes, navigation). For navigation, `browser_go_to_url` is a more robust alternative when a direct URL is known. For form submissions or general action triggers, `browser_send_keys` with 'Enter' is often a more robust alternative, especially when direct clicking by index proves unreliable. Avoid clicking elements that are not currently visible or interactable.", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"index": {"type": "integer", "description": "The index number of the target element."}}, "required": ["index"]}}}

It cannot process content that is scrolled out of view or exists on other pages of a paginated list. While `accessibility tree` and `interactive elements` are primary for UI understanding, this visual tool can be a highly effective *primary* method for text extraction in challenging scenarios. **Crucially, for critical or structured data (e.g., IDs, specific names, numerical values), always cross-verify with or prefer extraction from the `webpage accessibility tree` as visual interpretation may introduce inaccuracies, especially for abbreviated or visually ambiguous elements.**", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"query": {"type": "string", "description": "Query to the VL model to get the browser page content."}}, "required": ["query"]}}}

</tools>

2. **Python Code Execution**
When executing Python code, please output:
<code>
... your code ...
</code>
- The working directory is `/workspace`
- Executing dangerous, destructive, or time-consuming code is prohibited.
- If both a **Tool Call** and **Python Code Execution** are included in the output, the tool call takes precedence, and the Python code will not be executed.
- Using outdated or limited python libraries may result in incomplete or inaccurate observations (e.g. missing images from PDFs or failing to extract key content). Always prefer robust, modern libraries to ensure full and reliable results.
- When performing file conversion or data extraction, always ensure **data integrity**. Verify that the structure, content, and critical fields of the source file are preserved in the output. Check row and column counts, headers, and key values before and after processing. **Avoid silent loss**, truncation, or unintended alteration of data.

## Action Execution Result Processing
- After each action is executed, an Observation is returned, which includes:
    1. `<tool_response>`: The result of the tool or code execution.
    2. `<tool_instruction>`: The instruction associated with a specific action, used to guide the next step or restrict subsequent behavior.
- **Note**: Do not fabricate observations.

## Security and Restrictions
- **Coding Actions (such as Python, CMD, etc.)**
    - Do not run high-risk operations that are large in code size or take a long time.
    - Do not execute code that could cause data loss, system damage, or irreversible changes.
    - Do not use the kill command with wildcards like * or other dangerous parameters that could result in a wide range of matches.
    - Prefer using the Python interpreter to execute code (safer and more efficient) rather than using the CMD tool.

> ⚠️ **Important**
> When your output contains content that fully conforms to the **Tool Call** or **Python Code Execution** format, the system will immediately parse, identify, and execute it as an **Action** without further confirmation and without reversal.
> Therefore, before outputting, always confirm that this is your **intended** action and fully assess the potential consequences and risks.
> If you are only using **quotes, demonstrations, or examples**, be sure to break the formatting or escape it to prevent the system from interpreting it as a real action.

# OBJECTIVE #
Your core objective is to independently and efficiently complete the tasks assigned to you by the company.


# MEMORY #
During previous tasks, you have accumulated the following reusable knowledge:

## Resolution Patterns
Comprehensive Contextualization: Systematically acquire and aggregate information from diverse, potentially unstructured sources, prioritizing local processing and cross-validation, to ensure a complete, coherent operational view and inform robust decisions.
Robust External Interaction: Prioritize stable, predictable interaction methods, such as structured APIs, and dynamically adapt strategies to ensure continuity and reliability with external systems despite their inconsistencies or volatility.
Adaptive Constraint Handling: When an objective is blocked by an unresolvable external constraint, acknowledge the limitation, perform necessary cleanup of partial artifacts, and adapt the strategy to proceed with viable data, avoiding unproductive retries.
Modular Resilient Design: Decompose operations into modular, decoupled units with explicit state management, to enhance predictability, isolate errors, improve maintainability, and ensure operational continuity.
Progressive Verification: Implement multi-stage validation, from granular checks within pipelines to comprehensive outcome validation, to localize errors, confirm system states, and ensure successful execution.

## Platform/Application Operation Guides
These guides summarize proven operation paths derived from past successful experiences.  
Each item is a structured reference designed to help you complete operations more quickly, accurately, and with reduced redundancy.

> This directory provides a comprehensive index of guides, compiling best practices and experience summaries for accomplishing various tasks.

### Recommended Usage Process
1. **Review the Guide First**  
   Before starting a task, browse the relevant entries in the directory to identify potentially useful guidance.  
2. **Targeted Access**  
   Use the `access_the_application_guide` tool to view detailed steps if necessary.  
3. **Reuse with Flexibility**  
   Apply past successful steps when they fit the current situation, but stay aware of possible mismatches.  
4. **Explore When Deviations Arise**  
   If the environment or results diverge from the guide, stop rigidly following it and explore alternative approaches through small, safe, and adaptive steps.

### Value of Guides
- Reduce task completion time by leveraging accumulated experience.  
- Lower error rates and avoid common pitfalls.  
- Ensure consistent, professional execution of tasks.  

### Guide Reliability & Adaptation
- Guides may be outdated, biased, or contain errors — they are “historical experience,” not absolute truth.  
- Use guides as starting points, not as strict rules.  
- When deviations or conflicts appear, **exit the guide and explore new paths** instead of persisting.  
- Record useful deviation points for later improvement of the guides.

The `webpage accessibility tree` reflects the true current UI."}
</Login>
</Application>
</tool_response>
<tool_instruction>
After accessing, carefully read the guide content. Extract and adapt relevant steps, recognizing that guide information may be outdated or require UI verification. Always prioritize current browser state by performing `browser_wait_and_get_update()` immediately before attempting to follow guide steps.
</tool_instruction>

07. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================
Thought: I have successfully accessed the RocketChat Login guide. The guide provides detailed steps for logging in, including navigating to the URL, waiting for updates, identifying input fields and buttons, inputting text, and clicking the login button. It also highlights the dynamic nature of element indices and the need to verify successful login.

Now I need to perform the login steps.
First, I will navigate to the RocketChat URL and then wait for the page to load to get the interactive elements.
Action:
<tool_call>
{"name": "browser_go_to_url", "arguments": {"url": "http://the-agent-company.com:3000/home"}}
</tool_call>
08. | ================================================== USER MESSAGE ==================================================
Observation: 
<tool_response>
Performed browser action: 🔗 Navigated to http://the-agent-company.com:3000/home
The updated browser page status is as follows:
<webpage accessibility tree>[SYSTEM INFO: History accessibility tree removed for brevity]</webpage accessibility tree>
<webpage interactive elements>[SYSTEM INFO: History interactive elements removed for brevity]</webpage interactive elements>

</tool_response>
<tool_instruction>
Always inspect the `webpage accessibility tree` and `webpage interactive elements` after navigation to confirm the page loaded as expected. This step is crucial for verifying successful navigation and for preparing for subsequent interactions by ensuring the browser state is as anticipated.
</tool_instruction>

09. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================
Thought: I have navigated to the RocketChat URL. The `webpage accessibility tree` shows "Rocket.Chat" and the URL, but the `webpage interactive elements` are not showing the login fields. This suggests the page might still be loading or has redirected to a state where the login elements are not immediately available. I need to wait for the page to fully load and then get an update of the interactive elements to find the username, password, and login button.
Action:
<tool_call>
{"name": "browser_wait_and_get_update", "arguments": {}}
</tool_call>
10. | ================================================== USER MESSAGE ==================================================
Observation: 
<tool_response>
Performed browser action: 🕒  Waiting for 3 seconds
The updated browser page status is as follows:
<webpage accessibility tree>[SYSTEM INFO: History accessibility tree removed for brevity]</webpage accessibility tree>
<webpage interactive elements>[SYSTEM INFO: History interactive elements removed for brevity]</webpage interactive elements>

</tool_response>
<tool_instruction>
If a `TimeoutError` occurs, the browser was unresponsive; consider `browser_go_to_url` to reset state. *Crucially, after waiting, always thoroughly analyze the updated `webpage accessibility tree` for the *presence* of expected content or changes (e.g., new chat messages, confirmation dialogs), and critically, for the *accuracy and freshness of interactive element indices* before performing subsequent actions.*
</tool_instruction>

11. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================
Thought: I have successfully waited for the page to load and identified the interactive elements for login. The `webpage interactive elements` now clearly show the input fields for 'Email or username' (index 6) and 'Password' (index 8), as well as the 'Login' button (index 9). I will now input the username, then the password, and finally click the login button. I will use `browser_wait_and_get_update()` after each input to ensure the UI updates correctly and to get fresh element indices if needed, although for simple input fields, it might not be strictly necessary. I will follow the guide's recommendation.
Action:
<tool_call>
{"name": "browser_input_text", "arguments": {"index": 6, "text": "theagentcompany"}}
</tool_call>
12. | ================================================== USER MESSAGE ==================================================
Observation:

## Verification of RocketChat Login

### Checklist Details
1.  **URL After Login Attempt**: The browser's URL after the login attempt remained `http://the-agent-company.com:3000/home`, as observed in the `webpage accessibility tree` in step 13 of the Task Agent's trajectory. This confirms a successful internal transition to the RocketChat home page rather than an error or redirect.
2.  **Login Elements Disappeared**: The 'Email or username' input field (index 6), 'Password' input field (index 8), and 'Login' button (index 9) were confirmed to be absent from the `webpage interactive elements` after the agent's click in step 13. This verifies that the login form successfully disappeared from the page.
3.  **Post-Login UI Elements Present**: The `webpage accessibility tree` and `webpage interactive elements` in step 13 clearly show the presence of critical post-login UI elements such as "Home", "Search", and "Directory" buttons. These elements signify successful access to the RocketChat dashboard.

### Conclusion
All verification checks confirm that the Task Agent has successfully logged into RocketChat. The subtask "Login to RocketChat" is complete.

SubTask2: Access RocketChat Directory
Goal: Successfully navigate to the RocketChat Directory page.
23. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================
Thought: I need to access the RocketChat Directory. I will check the "RocketChat" section of the `Platform/Application Operation Guide Directory` for relevant entries. "AccessConversation" and "NavigateToRoomsManagement" are listed, but I'm looking for something more specific to "Directory". I will check if there's a guide for "AccessDirectory" or similar, or a more general navigation guide. If not, I will explore the current page for a "Directory" link.

Looking at the guide directory, there is no specific "AccessDirectory" guide. However, I have successfully logged in, and the previous `webpage interactive elements` showed a "Directory" button. So, I will look for a guide that helps me navigate to a specific part of the application or a general navigation guide. Since there isn't a specific "AccessDirectory" guide, I will look at "AccessConversation" and "NavigateToRoomsManagement" to see how they navigate, and then apply that knowledge to navigate to the Directory. I will also consider simply clicking on the "Directory" element if it's present.

For now, I will check the "AccessConversation" guide as it might give hints on how to interact with the main RocketChat UI.

## Verification of RocketChat Directory Access

### Checklist Details
1.  **Current URL Verification**: The browser's current URL, as observed in the `RootWebArea` of the `webpage accessibility tree` in step 9 of the Task Agent's trajectory, is `http://the-agent-company.com:3000/directory/users`. This matches the expected URL for the RocketChat user directory, confirming successful navigation.
2.  **Page Header and Tab Selection Verification**: The `webpage accessibility tree` in step 9 shows 'Directory' as a level 2 `heading` and the 'Users' `tab` explicitly marked with `selected=True`. This confirms the correct page context and that the intended 'Users' tab is active.
3.  **Presence of User Data Verification**: The `webpage accessibility tree` in step 9 includes `columnheader` elements for 'Name', 'Email', and 'Joined at' within a table structure. Additionally, specific user entries, such as 'Sarah Johnson', are visible, indicating that structured user data has loaded successfully in the directory.

SubTask4: Generate Presentation Slides
Goal: Create a PowerPoint presentation (PPTX) with 5 slides, each dedicated to one leadership team member (CTO, Sales Director, Marketing Manager, Finance Director, Human Resources Manager) in the specified order, including their name, position, and introduction.
47. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================
Thought: I need to generate presentation slides in PPTX format. This typically requires a Python library like `python-pptx`. I will need to check if this library is installed and install it if necessary. Then I will use Python code to create the slides.

I will check the `System` guides for anything related to writing files or installing packages.
Relevant guides:
- `System: WriteFile`
- `System: InstallPythonPackage`
- `System: WriteExcelFileXLSX` (This might provide a general approach for generating office documents using Python)

I will access these guides.

## Verification of Presentation Slides Generation

### Checklist Details
1.  **File Existence and Type Verification**:
    *   The command `ls -l /workspace/leadership_intro.pptx` executed successfully, confirming the presence of the `leadership_intro.pptx` file in the `/workspace` directory, as seen in Observation 07.
    *   The command `file /workspace/leadership_intro.pptx` identified the file type as `Microsoft PowerPoint 2007+`, indicating it is a valid PowerPoint presentation file, as observed in Observation 08.
2.  **Number of Slides Verification**:
    *   A Python script was executed to programmatically open the generated `.pptx` file and count the number of slides. The output from the script, as shown in Observation 10, explicitly states `Number of slides: 5`, which matches the subtask requirement of creating 5 slides.
3.  **Content and Order Verification (First Slide)**:
    *   The same Python script extracted the title of the first slide. The script's output in Observation 10 confirmed the title as `CTO: Sarah Johnson`, which correctly corresponds to the expected first leadership team member (CTO) and includes their name.
4.  **Content and Order Verification (Last Slide)**:
    *   The Python script also extracted the title of the last slide. The output in Observation 10 confirmed the title as `Human Resources Manager: Chen Xinyi`, which correctly corresponds to the expected last leadership team member (Human Resources Manager) and includes their name, ensuring the correct order and content generation.

### Conclusion
All verification checks confirm that the Task Agent has successfully generated the PowerPoint presentation slides as required. The file `leadership_intro.pptx` exists, is a valid PowerPoint file, contains exactly 5 slides, and the titles of the first and last slides match the expected leadership team members and their positions, confirming correct content and ordering. Therefore, the subtask "Generate Presentation Slides" is complete.

## Verification of Notify HR Manager Subtask

### Checklist Details
1.  **Navigation to HR Manager Chat Verification**: Confirmed that the browser successfully navigated to the direct message conversation with Chen Xinyi. This was verified by the URL `http://the-agent-company.com:3000/direct/CZYWHd5bCmhj5YcFec2uqaen3naCexvzDE` and the `heading 'chen_xinyi', level=1` present in the `webpage accessibility tree` in Observation 07.
2.  **Message Content Input Verification**: Verified that the exact message "Hi Chen Xinyi, I have completed the leadership introduction presentation and saved it as /workspace/leadership_intro.pptx." was correctly input into the message text area. This was confirmed by the `StaticText` content within the `textbox 'Message'` in the `webpage accessibility tree` in Observation 09.
3.  **Message Display in Chat History Verification**: Confirmed that the sent message is visible as a new entry in the chat history. The `webpage accessibility tree` in Observation 11 showed a `paragraph` element containing the message content, along with `StaticText 'theagentcompany'` (sender) and `StaticText '9:06 PM'` (timestamp), indicating successful transmission.
4.  **Message Input Field Cleared Verification**: Verified that the message input field was cleared after the message was sent. The `textbox 'Message'` in the `webpage accessibility tree` in Observation 11 no longer contained the message text, which is a common indicator of successful message transmission.

### Conclusion
All verification checks confirm that the Task Agent has successfully sent a RocketChat message to the HR Manager, Chen Xinyi, notifying them about the completion of the task and the availability of the presentation file. Therefore, the subtask "Notify HR Manager" is complete.
