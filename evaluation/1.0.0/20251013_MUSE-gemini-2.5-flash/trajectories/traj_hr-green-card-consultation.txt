# ACTION #
During task execution, you can perform **Actions**, including:
1. **Tool Call**
2. **Python Code Execution**

## Action Output Format
1. **Tool Call**
When calling a tool, please output:
<tool_call>
{"name": "<function-name>", "arguments": <args-json-object>}
</tool_call>
- `<function-name>`: Tool function name
- `<args-json-object>`: Call arguments (JSON format)
- If multiple `<tool_call>` are output at once, only the first one will be executed; the rest will be ignored.

Available tool signatures are provided within the `<tools>` tag:
<tools>
{"type": "function", "function": {"name": "extract_image_content_by_gpt4o", "description": "Utilizes `gpt-4o` to interpret and extract content from local image files (e.g., PNG, JPEG). Highly effective for **scanned documents, image-based PDFs (post-conversion to image formats),** or visual data. For optimal extraction, craft precise queries. **Caution: While effective for general content, direct numerical or highly structured extraction from complex visual elements (e.g., tally marks, handwritten notes) may be imprecise; robust post-processing is often required. For multi-page documents, convert each page into a separate image and ensure *all* generated image pages are processed for complete data extraction.**", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"image_path": {"type": "string", "description": "Local image path."}, "query": {"type": "string", "description": "Query to the gpt-4o to get the image content."}}, "required": ["image_path", "query"]}}}

Element indices are dynamic and highly volatile; always verify the target element's existence and index using `browser_wait_and_get_update` immediately before clicking. Be aware that even with immediate updates, indices can shift in very dynamic UIs. Crucially, after clicking, always use `browser_wait_and_get_update` to immediately re-evaluate the page state and confirm the intended effect (e.g., UI changes, navigation). For navigation, `browser_go_to_url` is a more robust alternative when a direct URL is known. For form submissions or general action triggers, `browser_send_keys` with 'Enter' is often a more robust alternative, especially when direct clicking by index proves unreliable. Avoid clicking elements that are not currently visible or interactable.", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"index": {"type": "integer", "description": "The index number of the target element."}}, "required": ["index"]}}}

It cannot process content that is scrolled out of view or exists on other pages of a paginated list. While `accessibility tree` and `interactive elements` are primary for UI understanding, this visual tool can be a highly effective *primary* method for text extraction in challenging scenarios. **Crucially, for critical or structured data (e.g., IDs, specific names, numerical values), always cross-verify with or prefer extraction from the `webpage accessibility tree` as visual interpretation may introduce inaccuracies, especially for abbreviated or visually ambiguous elements.**", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"query": {"type": "string", "description": "Query to the VL model to get the browser page content."}}, "required": ["query"]}}}

The `webpage interactive elements` from its output are highly dynamic and should be used immediately. For verifying responses or dynamic updates, consider setting `seconds` to a value appropriate for expected latency (e.g., `seconds=1` for immediate state, longer for human-like response times). **This tool is a fundamental prerequisite for almost all subsequent browser interactions due to the highly dynamic nature of web UI element indices.**", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"seconds": {"type": "integer", "description": "The number of seconds to wait, the default is 3 seconds.", "default": 3}}, "required": []}}}

Complex shell features like command chaining (`&&`, `||`), pipes (`|`), I/O redirection (`>`, `>>`), and backgrounding (`&`) are often *not reliably interpreted by `run_cmd` directly* and can lead to unexpected behavior or errors (e.g., `SyntaxError`, `command not found`). For any non-trivial shell interaction or complex logic, *always prefer consolidating operations into a single Python script that uses `subprocess` for explicit control and robustness* over multiple `run_cmd` calls or complex shell syntax.** 3) Quote arguments containing spaces (`\"path with spaces\"`). 4) State changes (`cd`) do not persist across calls.", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"command": {"type": "string", "description": "command暂时没有参数描述"}}, "required": ["command"]}}}
</tools>

2. **Python Code Execution**
When executing Python code, please output:
<code>
... your code ...
</code>
- The working directory is `/workspace`
- Executing dangerous, destructive, or time-consuming code is prohibited.
- If both a **Tool Call** and **Python Code Execution** are included in the output, the tool call takes precedence, and the Python code will not be executed.
- Using outdated or limited python libraries may result in incomplete or inaccurate observations (e.g. missing images from PDFs or failing to extract key content). Always prefer robust, modern libraries to ensure full and reliable results.
- When performing file conversion or data extraction, always ensure **data integrity**. Verify that the structure, content, and critical fields of the source file are preserved in the output. Check row and column counts, headers, and key values before and after processing. **Avoid silent loss**, truncation, or unintended alteration of data.

## Action Execution Result Processing
- After each action is executed, an Observation is returned, which includes:
    1. `<tool_response>`: The result of the tool or code execution.
    2. `<tool_instruction>`: The instruction associated with a specific action, used to guide the next step or restrict subsequent behavior.
- **Note**: Do not fabricate observations.

## Security and Restrictions
- **Coding Actions (such as Python, CMD, etc.)**
    - Do not run high-risk operations that are large in code size or take a long time.
    - Do not execute code that could cause data loss, system damage, or irreversible changes.
    - Do not use the kill command with wildcards like * or other dangerous parameters that could result in a wide range of matches.
    - Prefer using the Python interpreter to execute code (safer and more efficient) rather than using the CMD tool.

> ⚠️ **Important**
> When your output contains content that fully conforms to the **Tool Call** or **Python Code Execution** format, the system will immediately parse, identify, and execute it as an **Action** without further confirmation and without reversal.
> Therefore, before outputting, always confirm that this is your **intended** action and fully assess the potential consequences and risks.
> If you are only using **quotes, demonstrations, or examples**, be sure to break the formatting or escape it to prevent the system from interpreting it as a real action.

# OBJECTIVE #
Your core objective is to independently and efficiently complete the tasks assigned to you by the company.


# MEMORY #
During previous tasks, you have accumulated the following reusable knowledge:

## Resolution Patterns
Comprehensive Contextualization: Systematically acquire and aggregate information from diverse, potentially unstructured sources, prioritizing local processing and cross-validation, to ensure a complete, coherent operational view and inform robust decisions.
Robust External Interaction: Prioritize stable, predictable interaction methods, such as structured APIs, and dynamically adapt strategies to ensure continuity and reliability with external systems despite their inconsistencies or volatility.
Adaptive Constraint Handling: When an objective is blocked by an unresolvable external constraint, acknowledge the limitation, perform necessary cleanup of partial artifacts, and adapt the strategy to proceed with viable data, avoiding unproductive retries.
Modular Resilient Design: Decompose operations into modular, decoupled units with explicit state management, to enhance predictability, isolate errors, improve maintainability, and ensure operational continuity.
Progressive Verification: Implement multi-stage validation, from granular checks within pipelines to comprehensive outcome validation, to localize errors, confirm system states, and ensure successful execution.

## Platform/Application Operation Guides
These guides summarize proven operation paths derived from past successful experiences.  
Each item is a structured reference designed to help you complete operations more quickly, accurately, and with reduced redundancy.

> This directory provides a comprehensive index of guides, compiling best practices and experience summaries for accomplishing various tasks.

### Recommended Usage Process
1. **Review the Guide First**  
   Before starting a task, browse the relevant entries in the directory to identify potentially useful guidance.  
2. **Targeted Access**  
   Use the `access_the_application_guide` tool to view detailed steps if necessary.  
3. **Reuse with Flexibility**  
   Apply past successful steps when they fit the current situation, but stay aware of possible mismatches.  
4. **Explore When Deviations Arise**  
   If the environment or results diverge from the guide, stop rigidly following it and explore alternative approaches through small, safe, and adaptive steps.

### Value of Guides
- Reduce task completion time by leveraging accumulated experience.  
- Lower error rates and avoid common pitfalls.  
- Ensure consistent, professional execution of tasks.  

### Guide Reliability & Adaptation
- Guides may be outdated, biased, or contain errors — they are “historical experience,” not absolute truth.  
- Use guides as starting points, not as strict rules.  
- When deviations or conflicts appear, **exit the guide and explore new paths** instead of persisting.  
- Record useful deviation points for later improvement of the guides.

If an `Element index does not exist` error is returned, it indicates extreme element volatility. **Always re-evaluate `webpage interactive elements` with `browser_wait_and_get_update` immediately before attempting a click, and crucially, confirm the element's `text` or `aria-label` attribute semantically matches the intended target.** If direct clicking by index proves unreliable, *especially within dynamic lists or sidebars (e.g., chat contact lists)*, consider alternative strategies like using an application's built-in search functionality or `browser_go_to_url` if a direct link is known, rather than repeatedly retrying. For form submissions or general action triggers, `browser_send_keys` with 'Enter' is a more robust alternative and **highly recommended for reliability**.

Title: OwnCloud Login Subtask Verification Report

Checklist Details:
- **Check 1: Verify Final URL**
    - **Status**: PASSED
    - **Reason**: The browser successfully navigated to `http://the-agent-company.com:8092/index.php/apps/files/?dir=%2F&fileid=5` (Observation 11), which is the expected URL for the OwnCloud file management interface after login.
- **Check 2: Verify Presence of File Management Elements**
    - **Status**: PASSED
    - **Reason**: The `webpage accessibility tree` in Observation 11 and 13 clearly shows elements like "Files", "Documents", and "Downloads", confirming access to the file management interface.
- **Check 3: Verify Absence of Login Form Elements**
    - **Status**: PASSED
    - **Reason**: The username and password input fields and the login button, present in Observation 5, are no longer visible in the `webpage interactive elements` in Observation 13, indicating the login form is no longer displayed.
- **Check 4: Verify Displayed Username**
    - **Status**: PASSED
    - **Reason**: The `webpage accessibility tree` in Observation 13 explicitly contains the text "theagentcompany" associated with a link, confirming the username is displayed on the page as expected after a successful login.

Title: OwnCloud Directory Navigation Subtask Verification Report

Checklist Details:
- **Check 1: Verify Final URL**
    - **Status**: PASSED
    - **Reason**: The browser's final URL (`http://the-agent-company.com:8092/index.php/apps/files?dir=%2FDocuments%2FHuman+Resources+Team%2FImmigration&fileid=270` from Observation 5) correctly points to the 'Documents/Human Resources Team/Immigration' directory. The minor differences in URL encoding (`%20` vs `+`) and the `fileid` parameter do not alter the fact that the browser is in the correct directory.
- **Check 2: Verify Page Title**
    - **Status**: PASSED
    - **Reason**: The `RootWebArea` title in Observation 5 is 'Immigration - Files - ownCloud', which accurately reflects the current directory and OwnCloud application context.
- **Check 3: Verify Breadcrumbs Path**
    - **Status**: PASSED
    - **Reason**: The `webpage accessibility tree` in Observation 5 explicitly displays the hierarchical breadcrumbs 'Home', 'Documents', 'Human Resources Team', and 'Immigration' as interactive links, confirming the correct navigation path.
- **Check 4: Verify File Presence**
    - **Status**: PASSED
    - **Reason**: The `webpage accessibility tree` in Observation 5 lists a link for 'Dates_For_Filing .png' within the directory content, confirming the presence of the specific file mentioned in the overall task context.

Thought: The `wget` command failed with a `404 Not Found` error, even though the `returncode` was 8. This indicates that the constructed WebDAV URL was incorrect or the file was not found at that exact path. The `401 Unauthorized` error might be a red herring or an initial authentication attempt that failed before the 404. I need to re-evaluate how to get the correct WebDAV URL.

Title: RocketChat Login Subtask Verification Report

Checklist Details:
- **Check 1: Verify Final URL**
    - **Status**: PASSED
    - **Reason**: The browser's URL after the login attempt is `http://the-agent-company.com:3000/home`, as seen in the `RootWebArea` of Observation 11. This URL is consistent with the RocketChat application's homepage after successful login.
- **Check 2: Verify Presence of Post-Login Dashboard Elements**
    - **Status**: PASSED
    - **Reason**: The `webpage accessibility tree` in Observation 11 clearly shows elements such as "Home", "Search", "Directory" buttons, and channel lists (e.g., "general", "kudos"), and direct message links (e.g., "mike_chen", "chen_xinyi"). These elements are characteristic of a successful login to the RocketChat dashboard, confirming the UI has transitioned to the application's main interface.
- **Check 3: Verify Absence of Login Form Elements**
    - **Status**: PASSED
    - **Reason**: The `webpage interactive elements` in Observation 11 do not contain the username or password input fields, nor the "Login" button that were present in previous observations (e.g., Observation 5). Their absence confirms that the login form is no longer displayed.

Conclusion:
Based on the comprehensive verification checks, Subtask 4: "Login to RocketChat" is **complete**. The Task Agent successfully logged into RocketChat, and the application interface displays as expected for a logged-in user.

The Check Agent reports that the current Subtask has been completed. The above is the check report from the Check Agent.

I need a more robust way to find Priya Sharma and send her a message. I will try using the global search functionality. Looking at the `webpage interactive elements`, I see a "Search" button at index 5. I will click this to open the search interface.

Title: RocketChat Contact Subtask Verification Report

Checklist Details:
- **Check 1: Verify Sent Message**
    - **Status**: PASSED
    - **Reason**: The message sent by the Task Agent to Priya Sharma ("Hi Priya, I'm helping you with your green card backlog query. Could you please provide your green card category and birth country so I can find the current filing date from the screenshot?") is clearly visible as a `paragraph` element in the `webpage accessibility tree` in Observation 31, confirming successful transmission.
- **Check 2: Verify Reply Received**
    - **Status**: PASSED
    - **Reason**: A new message, clearly identified as being from 'priya_sharma' through `StaticText 'priya_sharma'` and a subsequent `paragraph` element, appeared in the chat interface within the `webpage accessibility tree` in Observation 31, confirming a reply was received.
- **Check 3: Verify Reply Content**
    - **Status**: PASSED
    - **Reason**: The content of Priya Sharma's reply, extracted from Observation 31, is: "Hi there! Sure, I applied under the NIW category and my birth country is Nepal. Let me know if you need any more information." This message explicitly provides both the green card category ("NIW") and birth country ("Nepal"), which were the specific pieces of information requested by the subtask goal.

Conclusion:
Based on the comprehensive verification checks, Subtask 5: "Contact Priya Sharma for details" is **complete**. The Task Agent successfully sent the message and obtained the required green card category and birth country from Priya Sharma.

<tool_instruction>
After extraction, always rigorously review the output for accuracy, completeness, and adherence to requested formatting. Recognize that visual models may misinterpret details or omit information, especially in ambiguous visual contexts. For critical numerical or structured data, consider a two-step approach: first, extract a detailed natural language description, and then programmatically parse that description for precise values. Robust programmatic parsing and validation are often required, especially when consolidating results from multiple images (e.g., multi-page PDFs). If a specific keyword or phrase is being sought, a more targeted query may improve results.

Title: Subtask 6: Extract information from the screenshot Verification Report

Checklist Details:
-   **Check 1: Verify Tool Call and Output Structure**
    -   **Status**: PASSED
    -   **Reason**: The `extract_image_content_by_gpt4o` tool was successfully invoked by the Task Agent in Observation 04 with a clear query requesting structured data. The `tool_response` in Observation 05 provided data in the requested list of dictionaries format, confirming successful tool execution and correct structural output.

-   **Check 2: Verify Data Completeness in Tool Response**
    -   **Status**: FAILED
    -   **Reason**: The data returned in the `tool_response` (Observation 05) was truncated. The last entry, `{"Category": "5th Unreserved (`, was incomplete, and the overall JSON list was not properly closed. This indicates that the full set of green card categories, countries, and filing dates was not completely extracted from the image.

-   **Check 3: Verify Agent's Final Answer Consistency**
    -   **Status**: PASSED
    -   **Reason**: The data presented in the Task Agent's "Final Answer" (Observation 06) is identical to the `tool_response` received in Observation 05. The agent accurately reported the data it received, without any further alteration or omission, despite the data itself being incomplete.

Conclusion:
Based on the verification checks, Subtask 6: "Extract information from the screenshot" is **incomplete**. While the Task Agent successfully invoked the `extract_image_content_by_gpt4o` tool and consistently reported the received output, the critical issue of data truncation means that the subtask's goal to "accurately extract the green card filing dates and associated categories/countries" was not fully met. The extracted information is not complete.
</check_report>

Based on analyzing the current Subtask, its goal, and **your Subtask's execution trajectory**, the Check Agent reports that the current Subtask has failed to complete. The above is the Check Agent's check report.
Please combine this check report with the current Subtask's historical execution trajectory to analyze the key obstacles currently hindering task completion and develop an actionable plan for the next steps.


105. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================
* The current Subtask still has the following issues:
    1. The `extract_image_content_by_gpt4o` tool returned an incomplete JSON list, indicating that not all data from the image was extracted. The last entry was truncated, and the JSON was not properly closed.
    2. The current query to `gpt-4o` may not be sufficiently precise or robust to handle the image content, leading to incomplete extraction.

* Consider trying the following actions:
    1. Re-execute `extract_image_content_by_gpt4o` with a more explicit query, specifically requesting the information in a structured, table-like text format rather than a JSON list, to see if that improves completeness. I will ask it to extract the data as a markdown table or simply as raw text that I can then parse.
    2. If the above still fails to produce a complete result, I will simplify the query further to just describe the image content or extract text without imposing a strict structure, and then manually parse the relevant information using Python code.

After extraction, always rigorously review the output for accuracy, completeness, and adherence to requested formatting. Recognize that visual models may misinterpret details or omit information, especially in ambiguous visual contexts. For critical numerical or structured data, consider a two-step approach: first, extract a detailed natural language description, and then programmatically parse that description for precise values. Robust programmatic parsing and validation are often required, especially when consolidating results from multiple images (e.g., multi-page PDFs). If a specific keyword or phrase is being sought, a more targeted query may improve results.

Thought: The previous attempt to extract data as a markdown table, while an improvement, still resulted in truncation. This suggests that the vision model might have limitations in producing complete structured output for large amounts of data. To overcome this, I will try a more robust approach: simply ask the vision model to extract *all* text content from the image without imposing any specific formatting (like a table or JSON). Once I have the raw text, I can then use Python code to parse and structure it into the desired format (list of dictionaries). This delegates the parsing to a more controlled environment (Python) where I can implement specific logic to handle potential inconsistencies or re-formatting needs.

Thought: I have obtained the complete raw text content from the image. This is a significant step forward as the previous structured extraction attempts were truncated. Now, I need to parse this raw text into a structured format (list of dictionaries) which is necessary to complete the goal of "accurately extract the green card filing dates and associated categories/countries". The previous `tool_instruction` explicitly recommended programmatic parsing for critical data.

I will use a Python script to:
1. Define the raw text extracted from the image.
2. Define the ordered list of countries as column headers.
3. Iterate through the lines of the text, identify category headers, and then collect the subsequent 5 lines as filing dates for each of the defined countries under that category.
4. Store this structured data in a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a row with 'Category', 'Country', and 'Filing Date' keys.
5. Output the resulting structured data.

This programmatic parsing will ensure accuracy and completeness for this subtask.

Title: Subtask 6: Extract information from the screenshot Verification Report

Checklist Details:
-   **Check 1: Verify Raw Text Extraction Completeness**
    -   **Status**: PASSED
    -   **Reason**: The `tool_response` in Observation 13, which contains the raw text extracted from the image, was found to be complete and untruncated. All expected categories and their corresponding five country-specific filing dates were present, aligning perfectly with the visual content of the image.

-   **Check 2: Verify Python Parsing Logic and Output Completeness**
    -   **Status**: PASSED
    -   **Reason**: The Python code in Observation 14 correctly implemented the parsing logic to process the raw text from Observation 13. The `stdout` in Observation 15 confirms that the script executed successfully and produced a complete JSON array containing 50 entries (10 categories * 5 countries), matching the expected number of data points. The parsing logic effectively transformed the raw text into the desired structured format without any loss or omission of data.

-   **Check 3: Verify Data Accuracy and Structure**
    -   **Status**: PASSED
    -   **Reason**: Cross-referencing several sample entries from the final structured data in Observation 16 with the raw text in Observation 13 confirmed the accuracy of the extracted categories, countries, and filing dates. The final output is consistently a list of dictionaries, with each dictionary containing the keys 'Category', 'Country', and 'Filing Date', as specified by the subtask goal.

Conclusion:
Based on the comprehensive verification checks, Subtask 6: "Extract information from the screenshot" is **complete**. The Task Agent successfully extracted all green card filing dates, categories, and countries from the `Dates_For_Filing.png` screenshot, and the final data is accurate, complete, and correctly structured.

* The task can be divided into the following subtasks:
    1. Determine Priya's Filing Date: Identify Priya Sharma's green card filing date by cross-referencing her category (NIW) and birth country (Nepal) with the extracted data.
    2. Inform Priya Sharma: Communicate Priya Sharma's current green card filing date to her via RocketChat.

SubTask7: Determine Priya's Filing Date
Goal: Identify Priya Sharma's green card filing date by cross-referencing her category (NIW) and birth country (Nepal) with the extracted data.
119. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================
Thought: The goal is to determine Priya's filing date by searching the extracted data using her category (NIW) and birth country (Nepal). This is a direct lookup operation on the already structured data. I will use Python code to iterate through the list of dictionaries, find the matching entry, and extract the "Filing Date". Since "NIW" is not explicitly listed as a category, I need to consider how it maps to the existing categories. Typically, NIW (National Interest Waiver) falls under the EB-2 (2nd preference) category. I will assume this mapping for now. If no direct match is found for "Nepal" within "2nd" category, I will look for "All Chargeability Areas Except Those Listed" as a fallback for Nepal.

There are no specific `Platform/Application Operation Guide Directory` entries that directly apply to this data lookup task, as it's a programmatic search within already extracted data. I will proceed with Python code directly.

121. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================
Thought: The Python code successfully identified Priya Sharma's filing date as "01AUG23" by mapping her NIW category to "2nd" and her country (Nepal) to "All Chargeability Areas Except Those Listed" within the extracted data. This directly answers the subtask's objective of determining her filing date.
Final Answer: Priya Sharma's green card filing date is 01AUG23.

Title: Subtask 7: Determine Priya's Filing Date Verification Report

Checklist Details:
- **Check 1: Verify Filing Date Lookup Accuracy**
    - **Status**: PASSED
    - **Reason**: The proactive re-execution of the Task Agent's lookup logic, using the same `extracted_data`, `priya_category` ("2nd"), and `priya_country` ("Nepal") as provided in Observation 2, confirmed that the filing date '01AUG23' is correctly identified. The `stdout` of the re-executed code (`Priya Sharma's Filing Date: 01AUG23`) perfectly matches the Task Agent's result in Observation 3.

- **Check 2: Verify Data Consistency with Previous Subtask**
    - **Status**: PASSED
    - **Reason**: The `extracted_data` array, which the Task Agent hardcoded into its Python script in Observation 2, was confirmed to be identical in content, structure, and completeness (50 entries with 'Category', 'Country', 'Filing Date' keys) to the data successfully extracted and verified in Subtask 6, as described in Subtask 6's `check_report` within the `done_subtasks` section.

- **Check 3: Verify Final Answer Statement**
    - **Status**: PASSED
    - **Reason**: The Task Agent's final stated answer "Priya Sharma's green card filing date is 01AUG23" in Observation 4 directly matches the `stdout` of its Python code execution "Priya Sharma's Filing Date: 01AUG23" in Observation 3.

Conclusion:
Based on the comprehensive verification checks, Subtask 7: "Determine Priya's Filing Date" is **complete**. The Task Agent successfully identified Priya Sharma's filing date using the provided data and logic, and its final answer is consistent with the execution results.

    13. I have successfully determined Priya Sharma's green card filing date: `01AUG23`.

* The task can be divided into the following subtasks:
    1. Inform Priya Sharma: Communicate Priya Sharma's current green card filing date (01AUG23) to her via RocketChat.
126. | ================================================== USER MESSAGE ==================================================
SubTask8: Inform Priya Sharma
Goal: Communicate Priya Sharma's current green card filing date (01AUG23) to her via RocketChat.
127. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================
Thought: The current subtask is to inform Priya Sharma of her green card filing date via RocketChat. I have already successfully logged into RocketChat and initiated a direct message conversation with her. The relevant guide for sending messages in RocketChat is `RocketChat: SendMessage`.
Action:
<tool_call>
{"name": "access_the_application_guide", "arguments": {"application_name": "RocketChat", "item_names": ["SendMessage"]}}
</tool_call>

<Application name="RocketChat">
<SendMessage>
{'preconditions': 'User is logged into RocketChat and is currently viewing the active direct message or channel chat interface where the message is to be sent.', 'steps': 'browser_wait_and_get_update() -> Identify message input field index (e.g., `textarea` with \'placeholder="Message"\') from \'webpage interactive elements\' -> browser_input_text(index=<message_input_field_index>, text="<message_content>") -> browser_send_keys(keys="Enter") -> browser_wait_and_get_update()', 'notes': "Element indices are dynamic; always verify current page elements via `browser_wait_and_get_update()` and `webpage interactive elements`. If not already in the target channel or direct message, use `RocketChat: AccessConversation` or `Browser: NavigateToURL` (if the exact channel/DM URL is known, e.g., `http://the-agent-company.com:3000/channel/literaturereview`) to navigate there first. If an obstructing sidebar (e.g., channel details) is open, it may need to be closed first (e.g., via `Browser: DismissOverlay`). Replace `<message_content>` with the actual message. Successful sending verified by observing `webpage accessibility tree` for the presence of a `paragraph` element containing the message content, typically preceded by `StaticText` for the sender username (e.g., `StaticText 'theagentcompany'`) and a timestamp (e.g., `StaticText '10:28 PM'`). The message input field should also appear cleared after successful sending. For replies, allow additional time for `browser_wait_and_get_update()` (e.g., 5-10 seconds) then analyze `webpage accessibility tree`."}
</SendMessage>
</Application>
</tool_response>
<tool_instruction>
After accessing, carefully read the guide content. Extract and adapt relevant steps, recognizing that guide information may be outdated or require UI verification. Always prioritize current browser state by performing `browser_wait_and_get_update()` immediately before attempting to follow guide steps.
</tool_instruction>

129. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================
Thought: I have accessed the `SendMessage` guide. I am currently in the direct message conversation with Priya Sharma. I need to send her the filing date. The guide suggests using `browser_wait_and_get_update()` to get the current interactive elements, then `browser_input_text()` to type the message, and finally `browser_send_keys()` with "Enter" to send it. I will start by getting the current interactive elements to identify the message input field.

The updated browser page status is as follows:
<webpage accessibility tree>[SYSTEM INFO: History accessibility tree removed for brevity]</webpage accessibility tree>
<webpage interactive elements>[SYSTEM INFO: History interactive elements removed for brevity]</webpage interactive elements>

</tool_response>
<tool_instruction>
If a `TimeoutError` occurs, the browser was unresponsive; consider `browser_go_to_url` to reset state. *Crucially, after waiting, always thoroughly analyze the updated `webpage accessibility tree` for the *presence* of expected content or changes (e.g., new chat messages, confirmation dialogs), and critically, for the *accuracy and freshness of interactive element indices* before performing subsequent actions.*
</tool_instruction>

131. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================
Thought: I have successfully retrieved the current interactive elements. The message input field is a `textarea` with `placeholder="Message"` and is at index 76. I will now input the determined filing date into this field and send the message.
Action:
<tool_call>
{"name": "browser_input_text", "arguments": {"index": 76, "text": "Hi Priya, your current green card filing date for the NIW category and Nepal is 01AUG23."}}

<webpage interactive elements>[SYSTEM INFO: History interactive elements removed for brevity]</webpage interactive elements>

</tool_response>
<tool_instruction>
After inputting text, always use `browser_wait_and_get_update` to verify the text input, check for immediate validation feedback, or confirm any UI changes (e.g., enable/disable buttons, form submission readiness). Be especially mindful of index volatility, as UI changes can rapidly invalidate previously retrieved indices.

<tool_instruction>
After sending keys, *especially when a response or UI change is expected (e.g., chat message sent, form submitted)*, immediately use `browser_wait_and_get_update` to refresh the page state and verify the intended effect (e.g., message displayed, UI updated, data persisted).
</tool_instruction>

135. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================
Thought: The message containing Priya Sharma's filing date has been successfully sent and is visible in the chat history within the `webpage accessibility tree`. This confirms that the goal of communicating the filing date to her via RocketChat has been achieved.
Final Answer: Successfully communicated Priya Sharma's current green card filing date (01AUG23) to her via RocketChat.
