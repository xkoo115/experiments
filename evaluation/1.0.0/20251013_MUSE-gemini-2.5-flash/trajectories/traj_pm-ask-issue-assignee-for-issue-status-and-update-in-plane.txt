Complex shell features like command chaining (`&&`, `||`), pipes (`|`), I/O redirection (`>`, `>>`), and backgrounding (`&`) are often *not reliably interpreted by `run_cmd` directly* and can lead to unexpected behavior or errors (e.g., `SyntaxError`, `command not found`). For any non-trivial shell interaction or complex logic, *always prefer consolidating operations into a single Python script that uses `subprocess` for explicit control and robustness* over multiple `run_cmd` calls or complex shell syntax.** 3) Quote arguments containing spaces (`\"path with spaces\"`). 4) State changes (`cd`) do not persist across calls.", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"command": {"type": "string", "description": "command暂时没有参数描述"}}, "required": ["command"]}}}
</tools>

2. **Python Code Execution**
When executing Python code, please output:
<code>
... your code ...
</code>
- The working directory is `/workspace`
- Executing dangerous, destructive, or time-consuming code is prohibited.
- If both a **Tool Call** and **Python Code Execution** are included in the output, the tool call takes precedence, and the Python code will not be executed.
- Using outdated or limited python libraries may result in incomplete or inaccurate observations (e.g. missing images from PDFs or failing to extract key content). Always prefer robust, modern libraries to ensure full and reliable results.
- When performing file conversion or data extraction, always ensure **data integrity**. Verify that the structure, content, and critical fields of the source file are preserved in the output. Check row and column counts, headers, and key values before and after processing. **Avoid silent loss**, truncation, or unintended alteration of data.

## Action Execution Result Processing
- After each action is executed, an Observation is returned, which includes:
    1. `<tool_response>`: The result of the tool or code execution.
    2. `<tool_instruction>`: The instruction associated with a specific action, used to guide the next step or restrict subsequent behavior.
- **Note**: Do not fabricate observations.

## Security and Restrictions
- **Coding Actions (such as Python, CMD, etc.)**
    - Do not run high-risk operations that are large in code size or take a long time.
    - Do not execute code that could cause data loss, system damage, or irreversible changes.
    - Do not use the kill command with wildcards like * or other dangerous parameters that could result in a wide range of matches.
    - Prefer using the Python interpreter to execute code (safer and more efficient) rather than using the CMD tool.

> ⚠️ **Important**
> When your output contains content that fully conforms to the **Tool Call** or **Python Code Execution** format, the system will immediately parse, identify, and execute it as an **Action** without further confirmation and without reversal.
> Therefore, before outputting, always confirm that this is your **intended** action and fully assess the potential consequences and risks.
> If you are only using **quotes, demonstrations, or examples**, be sure to break the formatting or escape it to prevent the system from interpreting it as a real action.

# OBJECTIVE #
Your core objective is to independently and efficiently complete the tasks assigned to you by the company.


# MEMORY #
During previous tasks, you have accumulated the following reusable knowledge:

## Resolution Patterns
Comprehensive Contextualization: Systematically acquire and aggregate information from diverse, potentially unstructured sources, prioritizing local processing and cross-validation, to ensure a complete, coherent operational view and inform robust decisions.
Robust External Interaction: Prioritize stable, predictable interaction methods, such as structured APIs, and dynamically adapt strategies to ensure continuity and reliability with external systems despite their inconsistencies or volatility.
Adaptive Constraint Handling: When an objective is blocked by an unresolvable external constraint, acknowledge the limitation, perform necessary cleanup of partial artifacts, and adapt the strategy to proceed with viable data, avoiding unproductive retries.
Modular Resilient Design: Decompose operations into modular, decoupled units with explicit state management, to enhance predictability, isolate errors, improve maintainability, and ensure operational continuity.
Progressive Verification: Implement multi-stage validation, from granular checks within pipelines to comprehensive outcome validation, to localize errors, confirm system states, and ensure successful execution.

## Platform/Application Operation Guides
These guides summarize proven operation paths derived from past successful experiences.  
Each item is a structured reference designed to help you complete operations more quickly, accurately, and with reduced redundancy.

> This directory provides a comprehensive index of guides, compiling best practices and experience summaries for accomplishing various tasks.

### Recommended Usage Process
1. **Review the Guide First**  
   Before starting a task, browse the relevant entries in the directory to identify potentially useful guidance.  
2. **Targeted Access**  
   Use the `access_the_application_guide` tool to view detailed steps if necessary.  
3. **Reuse with Flexibility**  
   Apply past successful steps when they fit the current situation, but stay aware of possible mismatches.  
4. **Explore When Deviations Arise**  
   If the environment or results diverge from the guide, stop rigidly following it and explore alternative approaches through small, safe, and adaptive steps.

### Value of Guides
- Reduce task completion time by leveraging accumulated experience.  
- Lower error rates and avoid common pitfalls.  
- Ensure consistent, professional execution of tasks.  

### Guide Reliability & Adaptation
- Guides may be outdated, biased, or contain errors — they are “historical experience,” not absolute truth.  
- Use guides as starting points, not as strict rules.  
- When deviations or conflicts appear, **exit the guide and explore new paths** instead of persisting.  
- Record useful deviation points for later improvement of the guides.

Title: Subtask Completion Report: Login to RocketChat

Checklist Details:
- **verify_current_url**: The browser's current URL is `http://the-agent-company.com:3000/home`. This was verified by examining the `webpage accessibility tree` in the Task Agent's Observation at step 11, which shows `url='http://the-agent-company.com:3000/home'`. This URL is consistent with the RocketChat home page after a successful login.
- **verify_page_content_post_login**: Elements indicative of a successful login, such as navigation buttons ('Home', 'Search', 'Directory', 'Display', 'Create new', 'Administration'), channel lists ('general', 'kudos'), and direct message lists ('chen_xinyi', 'mike_chen'), are present in the `webpage accessibility tree`. This was confirmed by inspecting the Task Agent's Observation at step 11.
- **verify_absence_of_login_form**: The login form elements (username/email input, password input, login button) are no longer present in the `webpage interactive elements` after the login attempt. This was confirmed by comparing the `webpage interactive elements` at step 09 (where they were present) and step 11 (where they are absent).

Conclusion:
The Subtask "Login to RocketChat" is complete. All verification checks—current URL, presence of post-login UI elements, and absence of login form elements—confirm that the Task Agent successfully logged into the RocketChat platform and is ready to send messages.

Thought: I have tried to extract the index of the clickable link for "Zhang Wei" using `browser_extract_content_by_vision` twice, and both times it returned "64", which is the index of the table row, not the actual link. This indicates that `browser_extract_content_by_vision` is not precise enough for this specific task.

I also observed that the `webpage interactive elements` do not provide a direct index for the `link` element associated with "Zhang Wei".

Since direct clicking by index is not working and I don't have a direct URL for Zhang Wei's chat, I will try to use the search functionality again, but this time, I will search for the full name "Zhang Wei" in the "Users" directory.

Thought: I have tried to click the link for "Zhang Wei" multiple times, and it keeps failing due to index volatility. The `webpage interactive elements` show a `link` element at index 64 that contains all the details of "Zhang Wei", which is likely the entire row of the table. This is probably why clicking it is unreliable.

The `tool_instruction` suggests using `browser_go_to_url` if a direct link is known. I have identified the username for Zhang Wei as `zhang_wei` from the `webpage accessibility tree`. Based on the pattern of other direct message URLs (e.g., `/direct/CZYWHd5bCmhj5YcFec2uqaen3naCexvzDE` for `chen_xinyi`), it's reasonable to assume that the direct message URL for Zhang Wei would be `http://the-agent-company.com:3000/direct/zhang_wei`. I will try to navigate directly to this URL.

Checklist Details:
- **verify_current_url**: The browser's current URL is `http://the-agent-company.com:3000/direct/CZYWHd5bCmhj5YcFeuPsPimbJGg5gK3Eut`. This was verified by examining the `webpage accessibility tree` in the Task Agent's Observation at step 41, which explicitly shows `url='http://the-agent-company.com:3000/direct/CZYWHd5bCmhj5YcFeuPsPimbJGg5gK3Eut'` and `link 'zhang_wei'` with the same URL. This confirms successful navigation to the direct message conversation page for 'zhang_wei'.
- **verify_chat_header**: The chat interface clearly displays 'zhang_wei' as the recipient in the header. This was verified by examining the `webpage accessibility tree` in the Task Agent's Observation at step 41, which explicitly shows `heading 'zhang_wei', level=1` within the `main 'Channel'` section. This confirms that the correct conversation is open.
- **verify_message_input_field**: The presence of an active message input field is confirmed. This was verified by examining the `webpage accessibility tree` in the Task Agent's Observation at step 41, which explicitly shows a `textbox 'Message'` with `editable='plaintext'` within the `sectionfooter`. This indicates that the chat is ready for a message to be composed and sent.

Conclusion:
The Subtask "Contact Assignee 'Z' via RocketChat" is complete. The Task Agent has successfully navigated to the direct message conversation with "Zhang Wei" and the chat interface is ready for a message to be sent.
