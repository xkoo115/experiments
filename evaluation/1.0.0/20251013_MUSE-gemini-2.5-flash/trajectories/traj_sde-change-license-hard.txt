</tools>

2. **Python Code Execution**
When executing Python code, please output:
<code>
... your code ...
</code>
- The working directory is `/workspace`
- Executing dangerous, destructive, or time-consuming code is prohibited.
- If both a **Tool Call** and **Python Code Execution** are included in the output, the tool call takes precedence, and the Python code will not be executed.
- Using outdated or limited python libraries may result in incomplete or inaccurate observations (e.g. missing images from PDFs or failing to extract key content). Always prefer robust, modern libraries to ensure full and reliable results.
- When performing file conversion or data extraction, always ensure **data integrity**. Verify that the structure, content, and critical fields of the source file are preserved in the output. Check row and column counts, headers, and key values before and after processing. **Avoid silent loss**, truncation, or unintended alteration of data.

## Action Execution Result Processing
- After each action is executed, an Observation is returned, which includes:
    1. `<tool_response>`: The result of the tool or code execution.
    2. `<tool_instruction>`: The instruction associated with a specific action, used to guide the next step or restrict subsequent behavior.
- **Note**: Do not fabricate observations.

## Security and Restrictions
- **Coding Actions (such as Python, CMD, etc.)**
    - Do not run high-risk operations that are large in code size or take a long time.
    - Do not execute code that could cause data loss, system damage, or irreversible changes.
    - Do not use the kill command with wildcards like * or other dangerous parameters that could result in a wide range of matches.
    - Prefer using the Python interpreter to execute code (safer and more efficient) rather than using the CMD tool.

> ⚠️ **Important**
> When your output contains content that fully conforms to the **Tool Call** or **Python Code Execution** format, the system will immediately parse, identify, and execute it as an **Action** without further confirmation and without reversal.
> Therefore, before outputting, always confirm that this is your **intended** action and fully assess the potential consequences and risks.
> If you are only using **quotes, demonstrations, or examples**, be sure to break the formatting or escape it to prevent the system from interpreting it as a real action.

# OBJECTIVE #
Your core objective is to independently and efficiently complete the tasks assigned to you by the company.


# MEMORY #
During previous tasks, you have accumulated the following reusable knowledge:

## Resolution Patterns
Comprehensive Contextualization: Systematically acquire and aggregate information from diverse, potentially unstructured sources, prioritizing local processing and cross-validation, to ensure a complete, coherent operational view and inform robust decisions.
Robust External Interaction: Prioritize stable, predictable interaction methods, such as structured APIs, and dynamically adapt strategies to ensure continuity and reliability with external systems despite their inconsistencies or volatility.
Adaptive Constraint Handling: When an objective is blocked by an unresolvable external constraint, acknowledge the limitation, perform necessary cleanup of partial artifacts, and adapt the strategy to proceed with viable data, avoiding unproductive retries.
Modular Resilient Design: Decompose operations into modular, decoupled units with explicit state management, to enhance predictability, isolate errors, improve maintainability, and ensure operational continuity.
Progressive Verification: Implement multi-stage validation, from granular checks within pipelines to comprehensive outcome validation, to localize errors, confirm system states, and ensure successful execution.

## Platform/Application Operation Guides
These guides summarize proven operation paths derived from past successful experiences.  
Each item is a structured reference designed to help you complete operations more quickly, accurately, and with reduced redundancy.

> This directory provides a comprehensive index of guides, compiling best practices and experience summaries for accomplishing various tasks.

### Recommended Usage Process
1. **Review the Guide First**  
   Before starting a task, browse the relevant entries in the directory to identify potentially useful guidance.  
2. **Targeted Access**  
   Use the `access_the_application_guide` tool to view detailed steps if necessary.  
3. **Reuse with Flexibility**  
   Apply past successful steps when they fit the current situation, but stay aware of possible mismatches.  
4. **Explore When Deviations Arise**  
   If the environment or results diverge from the guide, stop rigidly following it and explore alternative approaches through small, safe, and adaptive steps.

### Value of Guides
- Reduce task completion time by leveraging accumulated experience.  
- Lower error rates and avoid common pitfalls.  
- Ensure consistent, professional execution of tasks.  

### Guide Reliability & Adaptation
- Guides may be outdated, biased, or contain errors — they are “historical experience,” not absolute truth.  
- Use guides as starting points, not as strict rules.  
- When deviations or conflicts appear, **exit the guide and explore new paths** instead of persisting.  
- Record useful deviation points for later improvement of the guides.

* The information you know and have obtained is:
    1. The task is to change the license of three repositories: JanusGraph, Colly, and Streamlit to the MIT license.
    2. I need to find these repositories on the GitLab wiki, accessible at `http://the-agent-company.com:8929/root/doc/-/wikis`.
    3. All repositories must be cloned locally into the `/workspace` directory.
    4. The license changes only need to be applied locally, no remote commits or pushes are required.
    5. The target license for all repositories is the MIT license.
    6. I have successfully navigated to the GitLab wiki page at `http://the-agent-company.com:8929/root/doc/-/wikis/home`.
    7. The page content contains "Useful Links" with links to "JanusGraph", "Colly", and "Streamlit" repositories, from which I can extract the clone URLs.

* The task can be divided into the following subtasks:
    1. Locate Repository Clone URLs: Identify and extract the clone URLs or paths for the JanusGraph, Colly, and Streamlit repositories from the GitLab wiki.
    2. Clone JanusGraph Repository: The JanusGraph repository is successfully cloned into the `/workspace` directory.
    3. Clone Colly Repository: The Colly repository is successfully cloned into the `/workspace` directory.

SubTask2: Locate Repository Clone URLs
Goal: Identify and extract the clone URLs or paths for the JanusGraph, Colly, and Streamlit repositories from the GitLab wiki.
15. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================
Thought: I need to extract the repository clone URLs from the current GitLab wiki page. The `Browser` application guide entries `AnalyzePageContent` and `WaitForPageUpdate` are relevant. I will access these guides to understand how to proceed.

17. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================
Thought: I have reviewed the `AnalyzePageContent` guide. It instructs me to analyze the `webpage accessibility tree` to extract information. I need to find the clone URLs for JanusGraph, Colly, and Streamlit. I will use `browser_wait_and_get_update` to ensure I have the most current page information, and then I will parse the `webpage accessibility tree` to locate the links.
Action:

<tool_instruction>
If a `TimeoutError` occurs, the browser was unresponsive; consider `browser_go_to_url` to reset state. *Crucially, after waiting, always thoroughly analyze the updated `webpage accessibility tree` for the *presence* of expected content or changes (e.g., new chat messages, confirmation dialogs), and critically, for the *accuracy and freshness of interactive element indices* before performing subsequent actions.*
</tool_instruction>

19. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================
Thought: I have successfully updated the browser page and analyzed the `webpage accessibility tree`. I have identified the links for JanusGraph, Colly, and Streamlit under the "Useful Links" heading. The clone URLs are:
*   JanusGraph: `http://the-agent-company.com:8929/root/janusgraph`
*   Colly: `http://the-agent-company.com:8929/root/colly`
*   Streamlit: `http://the-agent-company.com:8929/root/streamlit`

This completes the subtask of locating the repository clone URLs.
Final Answer:
JanusGraph Clone URL: http://the-agent-company.com:8929/root/janusgraph
Colly Clone URL: http://the-agent-company.com:8929/root/colly
Streamlit Clone URL: http://the-agent-company.com:8929/root/streamlit

- **Check 2: check_license_file_content**: A Python script was executed to read the content of `/workspace/janusgraph/LICENSE` and compare it against the expected MIT License text. The script's output, "Content matches: True", confirmed that the file's content precisely matches the MIT License text the Task Agent intended to write. (Passed)

Conclusion: The Subtask "Apply MIT License to JanusGraph" is complete. All verification steps confirm that a 'LICENSE' file containing the correct MIT License text has been successfully created or updated in the cloned JanusGraph repository.

* The information you know and have obtained is:
    1. The task is to change the license of three repositories: JanusGraph, Colly, and Streamlit to the MIT license.
    2. I need to find these repositories on the GitLab wiki, accessible at `http://the-agent-company.com:8929/root/doc/-/wikis`.
    3. All repositories must be cloned locally into the `/workspace` directory.
    4. The license changes only need to be applied locally, no remote commits or pushes are required.
    5. The target license for all repositories is the MIT license.
    6. I have successfully navigated to the GitLab wiki page at `http://the-agent-company.com:8929/root/doc/-/wikis/home`.
    7. I have identified and extracted the clone URLs for the repositories:
        *   JanusGraph: `http://the-agent-company.com:8929/root/janusgraph`
        *   Colly: `http://the-agent-company.com:8929/root/colly`
        *   Streamlit: `http://the-agent-company.com:8929/root/streamlit`
    8. The JanusGraph repository has been successfully cloned into `/workspace/janusgraph`.
    9. The Colly repository has been successfully cloned into `/workspace/colly`.
