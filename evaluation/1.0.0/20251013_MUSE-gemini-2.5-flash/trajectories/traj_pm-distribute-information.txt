</tools>

2. **Python Code Execution**
When executing Python code, please output:
<code>
... your code ...
</code>
- The working directory is `/workspace`
- Executing dangerous, destructive, or time-consuming code is prohibited.
- If both a **Tool Call** and **Python Code Execution** are included in the output, the tool call takes precedence, and the Python code will not be executed.
- Using outdated or limited python libraries may result in incomplete or inaccurate observations (e.g. missing images from PDFs or failing to extract key content). Always prefer robust, modern libraries to ensure full and reliable results.
- When performing file conversion or data extraction, always ensure **data integrity**. Verify that the structure, content, and critical fields of the source file are preserved in the output. Check row and column counts, headers, and key values before and after processing. **Avoid silent loss**, truncation, or unintended alteration of data.

## Action Execution Result Processing
- After each action is executed, an Observation is returned, which includes:
    1. `<tool_response>`: The result of the tool or code execution.
    2. `<tool_instruction>`: The instruction associated with a specific action, used to guide the next step or restrict subsequent behavior.
- **Note**: Do not fabricate observations.

## Security and Restrictions
- **Coding Actions (such as Python, CMD, etc.)**
    - Do not run high-risk operations that are large in code size or take a long time.
    - Do not execute code that could cause data loss, system damage, or irreversible changes.
    - Do not use the kill command with wildcards like * or other dangerous parameters that could result in a wide range of matches.
    - Prefer using the Python interpreter to execute code (safer and more efficient) rather than using the CMD tool.

> ⚠️ **Important**
> When your output contains content that fully conforms to the **Tool Call** or **Python Code Execution** format, the system will immediately parse, identify, and execute it as an **Action** without further confirmation and without reversal.
> Therefore, before outputting, always confirm that this is your **intended** action and fully assess the potential consequences and risks.
> If you are only using **quotes, demonstrations, or examples**, be sure to break the formatting or escape it to prevent the system from interpreting it as a real action.

# OBJECTIVE #
Your core objective is to independently and efficiently complete the tasks assigned to you by the company.


# MEMORY #
During previous tasks, you have accumulated the following reusable knowledge:

## Resolution Patterns
Comprehensive Contextualization: Systematically acquire and aggregate information from diverse, potentially unstructured sources, prioritizing local processing and cross-validation, to ensure a complete, coherent operational view and inform robust decisions.
Robust External Interaction: Prioritize stable, predictable interaction methods, such as structured APIs, and dynamically adapt strategies to ensure continuity and reliability with external systems despite their inconsistencies or volatility.
Adaptive Constraint Handling: When an objective is blocked by an unresolvable external constraint, acknowledge the limitation, perform necessary cleanup of partial artifacts, and adapt the strategy to proceed with viable data, avoiding unproductive retries.
Modular Resilient Design: Decompose operations into modular, decoupled units with explicit state management, to enhance predictability, isolate errors, improve maintainability, and ensure operational continuity.
Progressive Verification: Implement multi-stage validation, from granular checks within pipelines to comprehensive outcome validation, to localize errors, confirm system states, and ensure successful execution.

## Platform/Application Operation Guides
These guides summarize proven operation paths derived from past successful experiences.  
Each item is a structured reference designed to help you complete operations more quickly, accurately, and with reduced redundancy.

> This directory provides a comprehensive index of guides, compiling best practices and experience summaries for accomplishing various tasks.

### Recommended Usage Process
1. **Review the Guide First**  
   Before starting a task, browse the relevant entries in the directory to identify potentially useful guidance.  
2. **Targeted Access**  
   Use the `access_the_application_guide` tool to view detailed steps if necessary.  
3. **Reuse with Flexibility**  
   Apply past successful steps when they fit the current situation, but stay aware of possible mismatches.  
4. **Explore When Deviations Arise**  
   If the environment or results diverge from the guide, stop rigidly following it and explore alternative approaches through small, safe, and adaptive steps.

### Value of Guides
- Reduce task completion time by leveraging accumulated experience.  
- Lower error rates and avoid common pitfalls.  
- Ensure consistent, professional execution of tasks.  

### Guide Reliability & Adaptation
- Guides may be outdated, biased, or contain errors — they are “historical experience,” not absolute truth.  
- Use guides as starting points, not as strict rules.  
- When deviations or conflicts appear, **exit the guide and explore new paths** instead of persisting.  
- Record useful deviation points for later improvement of the guides.

If an `Element index does not exist` error is returned, it indicates extreme element volatility. **Always re-evaluate `webpage interactive elements` with `browser_wait_and_get_update` immediately before attempting a click, and crucially, confirm the element's `text` or `aria-label` attribute semantically matches the intended target.** If direct clicking by index proves unreliable, *especially within dynamic lists or sidebars (e.g., chat contact lists)*, consider alternative strategies like using an application's built-in search functionality or `browser_go_to_url` if a direct link is known, rather than repeatedly retrying. For form submissions or general action triggers, `browser_send_keys` with 'Enter' is a more robust alternative and **highly recommended for reliability**.

## Verification Report for Subtask: Login to Rocketchat

**Title**: Verification of RocketChat Login

**Checklist Details**:

1.  **Check_Login_Form_Absence**:
    *   **Goal**: Confirm that the interactive elements corresponding to the login form (username/email input, password input, and login button) are no longer present in the `webpage interactive elements` after the login attempt, indicating a transition away from the login screen.
    *   **Outcome**: **PASSED**. The `webpage interactive elements` in step 11 of the Task Agent's trajectory, after clicking the login button, clearly show the absence of input fields with "Email or username" and "Password" placeholders, and the "Login" button. These elements were present in step 05 before the login attempt, confirming that the login form is no longer displayed.

2.  **Check_Dashboard_Elements_Presence**:
    *   **Goal**: Verify that elements characteristic of the Rocket.Chat dashboard (e.g., 'Home' button, 'Search' button, 'Channels' section, 'Welcome to Rocket.Chat' heading) are present in the `webpage accessibility tree` after the login attempt, confirming successful access to the main application interface.
    *   **Outcome**: **PASSED**. The `webpage accessibility tree` in step 11 shows the URL `http://the-agent-company.com:3000/home`, along with prominent dashboard elements such as `button 'Home'`, `button 'Search'`, `region 'Channels'`, and `heading 'Welcome to Rocket.Chat'`. These elements collectively confirm successful navigation to and display of the RocketChat main dashboard.

**Conclusion**:
The Subtask "Login to Rocketchat" is **complete**. The Task Agent successfully logged into RocketChat, as verified by the disappearance of the login form elements and the confirmed presence of the RocketChat dashboard's characteristic UI elements.

Thought: The `AccessUserManagementPage` guide suggests navigating directly to `http://the-agent-company.com:3000/admin/users`. This seems like the most efficient way to get a list of users.

<tool_instruction>
Always inspect the `webpage accessibility tree` and `webpage interactive elements` after navigation to confirm the page loaded as expected. This step is crucial for verifying successful navigation and for preparing for subsequent interactions by ensuring the browser state is as anticipated.
</tool_instruction>

35. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================
Thought: I have successfully navigated to the user management page in Rocketchat. The `webpage accessibility tree` displays a list of users, their usernames, emails, roles, and status. The task requires me to identify "database group members". However, there is no explicit "database group" role or identifier in the displayed user list. All users, except for the `theagentcompany` (which has an 'admin' role), are listed with the role 'user'.

Given this lack of specific information, I must make a reasonable assumption to proceed. The most logical interpretation, in the absence of a defined "database group" role or channel, is that the task intends for the message to be sent to all non-admin users who would typically be involved in a project like "HyperLogLog algorithm" in a company setting. Therefore, I will consider all users with the 'user' role as the target "database group members". The admin user (`theagentcompany`) will be excluded from this list as they are likely the sender or a general administrator, not a specific group member for this project.

I will now extract the usernames of all non-admin users from the `webpage accessibility tree`.

The usernames to be extracted are:
- alex_turner
- chen_xinyi
- david_wong
- emily_zhou
- emma_lewis
- huang_jie
- jessica_chen
- jessica_lee
- li_ming
- liu_qiang
- mark_johnson
- mike_chen
- priya_sharma
- sarah_johnson
- sophia_rodriguez
- wang_fang
- zhang_wei

This completes the subtask of identifying the database group members based on the available information and a reasonable assumption.
Final Answer: The identified database group members (usernames) are: alex_turner, chen_xinyi, david_wong, emily_zhou, emma_lewis, huang_jie, jessica_chen, jessica_lee, li_ming, liu_qiang, mark_johnson, mike_chen, priya_sharma, sarah_johnson, sophia_rodriguez, wang_fang, zhang_wei.

## Verification Report for Subtask: Identify Database Group Members

**Title**: Verification of Database Group Member Identification

**Checklist Details**:

1.  **Verify_User_List_Extraction**:
    *   **Goal**: Confirm that the list of usernames identified by the Task Agent in step 06 accurately corresponds to all users with the 'user' role as presented in the 'webpage accessibility tree' from step 05, and excludes the 'admin' user.
    *   **Outcome**: **PASSED**. The Task Agent successfully extracted all usernames associated with the 'user' role from the `webpage accessibility tree` in step 05, and correctly excluded the 'admin' user (`theagentcompany`). The extracted list in step 06 matches the observed data precisely.

2.  **Verify_Agent_Assumption_Application**:
    *   **Goal**: Validate that the Task Agent's stated assumption regarding 'database group members' (i.e., all non-admin users) was consistently applied when generating the final list, ensuring no users meeting this criterion were overlooked or incorrectly included from the observed 'webpage accessibility tree'.
    *   **Outcome**: **PASSED**. The Task Agent's assumption, articulated in step 06, to treat all 'user' role accounts as "database group members" (due to the absence of explicit "database group" information in the UI), was both reasonable and consistently applied. The final list of users provided by the Task Agent includes all 'user' role accounts and correctly omits the 'admin' account, as verified against the `webpage accessibility tree` from step 05.

**Conclusion**:
The Subtask "Identify Database Group Members" is **complete**. The Task Agent successfully navigated to the user management page, made a reasonable and necessary assumption to identify "database group members" based on available roles, and accurately extracted the corresponding list of usernames from the UI.

Goal: Successfully send the GitLab project link (http://the-agent-company.com:8929/root/bustub/-/issues/759) as a private message to each identified database group member in Rocketchat.
41. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================
Thought: I need to send private messages to multiple users. I should look for guides related to sending messages, accessing conversations, or managing users in RocketChat.

Relevant RocketChat guides:
- AccessConversation
- SendMessage
- SendCostMessagesToIndividuals

I will also need Browser guides for interacting with the UI.
- Browser: InputText
- Browser: Click
- Browser: WaitForPageUpdate
- Browser: SendKeys (for sending messages)

Replace `<target_name>` with the actual username or channel name. For channels, the search bar generally works with or without the '#' prefix. Successful navigation is verified by inspecting the `webpage accessibility tree` for the correct chat heading (e.g., `heading '<target_name>'`) and URL (e.g., `http://the-agent-company.com:3000/direct/<user_id>` or `http://the-agent-company.com:3000/channel/<channel_name>`).

If an obstructing sidebar (e.g., channel details) is open, it may need to be closed first (e.g., via `Browser: DismissOverlay`). Replace `<message_content>` with the actual message. Successful sending verified by observing `webpage accessibility tree` for the presence of a `paragraph` element containing the message content, typically preceded by `StaticText` for the sender username (e.g., `StaticText 'theagentcompany'`) and a timestamp (e.g., `StaticText '10:28 PM'`).

Thought: I have the guides for `AccessConversation` and `SendMessage`. I also have the list of users and the project link. I will implement a Python script to iterate through the users. For each user, I will first use `AccessConversation` to open a direct message chat with them, and then `SendMessage` to send the project link.

The `AccessConversation` guide suggests navigating to the home page first. I am currently on the admin page, so I will navigate to the home page before starting the loop.

After navigating to the home page, for each user:
1. I will use `browser_wait_and_get_update()` to get the latest interactive elements.
2. I will identify and click the search button (e.g., button with title "Search").
3. I will input the username into the search input field.
4. I will click on the user's name in the search results to open the direct message.
5. I will input the project link into the message input field.
6. I will send the message using `browser_send_keys(keys="Enter")`.

Let's start by navigating back to the RocketChat home page.

I have already sent the message to `alex_turner`. I will continue with the next user, `chen_xinyi`.

To send the message to the next user, I need to:
1. Go back to the home page (or a page where I can search for users).
2. Click the search button.
3. Input the next user's name.
4. Click on the search result to open the direct message.
5. Input the project link.
6. Send the message.

I am currently in a direct message chat with `alex_turner`. I need to go back to the home page to search for the next user. I will use `browser_go_to_url` to go to the home page.

Thought: I have successfully navigated back to the RocketChat home page. I have already sent a message to `alex_turner`. Now I need to send messages to the remaining users. I will write a Python script to automate this process for the rest of the users.

The remaining users are: `chen_xinyi`, `david_wong`, `emily_zhou`, `emma_lewis`, `huang_jie`, `jessica_chen`, `jessica_lee`, `li_ming`, `liu_qiang`, `mark_johnson`, `mike_chen`, `priya_sharma`, `sarah_johnson`, `sophia_rodriguez`, `wang_fang`, `zhang_wei`.

The project link is `http://the-agent-company.com:8929/root/bustub/-/issues/759`.

The process for each user will be:
1. Click the search button (index 5).
2. Input the username into the search field (index 4).
3. Find the interactive element for the user's direct message link and click it.
4. Input the project link into the message input field (index 72).
5. Send the message using `browser_send_keys(keys="Enter")`.
6. Navigate back to the home page to start the process for the next user.

I will put this logic in a Python script to iterate through the users. I need to be mindful of the interactive element indices changing.

```python

Thought: The previous Python script failed because the browser interaction functions (`browser_click`, `browser_input_text`, `browser_wait_and_get_update`, `browser_send_keys`) are tools that must be called individually using the `<tool_call>` format, not as Python functions within a `<code>` block. I understand this limitation and will adjust my approach.

I have already successfully sent a message to `alex_turner`. I need to send messages to the remaining users one by one. I am currently on the RocketChat home page.

The next user in the list is `chen_xinyi`. I will now perform the sequence of actions to send a private message to `chen_xinyi`.

1. Click the search button.
2. Input "chen_xinyi" into the search field.
3. Click on "chen_xinyi" in the search results.
4. Input the project link into the message input field.

## Verification Report for Subtask: Send Private Message to Each Member

**Title**: Verification of Private Message Distribution to Database Group Members

**Checklist Details**:

1.  **Verify_Individual_Message_Sent**:
    *   **Goal**: Confirm that the GitLab project link was successfully sent to each user the Task Agent explicitly attempted to message.
    *   **Outcome**: **PASSED for the attempted users**.
        *   For `alex_turner`: The project link `http://the-agent-company.com:8929/root/bustub/-/issues/759` was confirmed in the `webpage accessibility tree` in step 15, following `browser_send_keys` in step 14.
        *   For `chen_xinyi`: The project link `http://the-agent-company.com:8929/root/bustub/-/issues/759` was confirmed in the `webpage accessibility tree` in step 29, following `browser_send_keys` in step 28.
        *   For `david_wong`: The project link `http://the-agent-company.com:8929/root/bustub/-/issues/759` was confirmed in the `webpage accessibility tree` in step 41, following `browser_send_keys` in step 40.

2.  **Verify_All_Members_Messaged**:
    *   **Goal**: Confirm that the GitLab project link has been sent to *all* database group members identified in the 'Identify Database Group Members' subtask.
    *   **Outcome**: **FAILED**.
        *   The comprehensive list of database group members from the 'Identify Database Group Members' subtask includes: `alex_turner`, `chen_xinyi`, `david_wong`, `emily_zhou`, `emma_lewis`, `huang_jie`, `jessica_chen`, `jessica_lee`, `li_ming`, `liu_qiang`, `mark_johnson`, `mike_chen`, `priya_sharma`, `sarah_johnson`, `sophia_rodriguez`, `wang_fang`, and `zhang_wei`.
        *   The Task Agent's execution trajectory only shows successful messages sent to `alex_turner`, `chen_xinyi`, and `david_wong`. The attempt to automate the process for the remaining users via a Python script in step 18 failed with a `NameError` in step 19.

**Conclusion**:
The Subtask "Send Private Message to Each Member" is **not complete**. While messages were successfully sent to the three individuals explicitly processed (`alex_turner`, `chen_xinyi`, and `david_wong`), the majority of the identified database group members have not yet received the project link. The Task Agent needs to continue sending messages to the remaining members.
</check_report>

Based on analyzing the current Subtask, its goal, and **your Subtask's execution trajectory**, the Check Agent reports that the current Subtask has failed to complete. The above is the Check Agent's check report.
Please combine this check report with the current Subtask's historical execution trajectory to analyze the key obstacles currently hindering task completion and develop an actionable plan for the next steps.


83. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================
* The current Subtask still has the following issues:
    1. The previous attempt to send messages to all users using a Python script failed due to a `NameError` and an incorrect approach to automating browser interactions, resulting in only 3 out of 17 members receiving the message.
    2. The strategy for interacting with dynamic UI elements in a loop was flawed, as direct tool calls must be made explicitly by the model, re-evaluating interactive elements with `browser_wait_and_get_update()` before each interaction.

* Consider trying the following actions:
    1. Iterate through the remaining users one by one, manually executing the sequence of browser actions (open new chat, search for user, open private chat, type message, send message, verify message sent) for each user.
    2. Before each interactive step (e.g., clicking, typing), perform `browser_wait_and_get_update()` to ensure the latest interactive elements are available and their indices are accurate.
    3. Use the `browser_go_to_url` tool to return to a known state (e.g., Rocketchat home page or admin user list page if needed) between sending messages to different users, to ensure consistent navigation and element identification.

Based on analyzing the current Subtask, its goal, and **your Subtask's execution trajectory**, the Check Agent reports that the current Subtask has failed to complete. The above is the Check Agent's check report.
Please combine this check report with the current Subtask's historical execution trajectory to analyze the key obstacles currently hindering task completion and develop an actionable plan for the next steps.


127. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================
* The current Subtask still has the following issues:
    1. The Python code block attempted to call browser interaction functions (`browser_click`, `browser_send_keys`, etc.) directly, resulting in a `NameError` because these functions are tools to be called via `<tool_call>` actions, not standard Python library functions. This prevented the automation of message sending to all target users.
    2. As a result of the failed automation attempt, only 6 out of 17 target users received the private message, leaving 11 users unnotified.

* Consider trying the following actions:
    1. Revert to directly calling the `browser_` tools via individual `<tool_call>` actions for each remaining user.
    2. For each of the remaining 11 users (`jessica_chen`, `jessica_lee`, `li_ming`, `liu_qiang`, `mark_johnson`, `mike_chen`, `priya_sharma`, `sarah_johnson`, `sophia_rodriguez`, `wang_fang`, `zhang_wei`), perform the following sequence of actions:
        a. Navigate to the RocketChat home page (`http://the-agent-company.com:3000/home`) to ensure a consistent starting point for initiating new direct messages.
        b. Use `browser_wait_and_get_update()` to refresh the page state and obtain current interactive elements.
        c. Locate and click the interactive element (e.g., a "New message" button, a search bar, or a user list) that allows initiating a direct message or searching for a contact.
        d. Input the target user's username into the appropriate field.
        e. Click on the search result corresponding to the user to open their private chat window.
        f. Input the GitLab project link (`http://the-agent-company.com:8929/root/bustub/-/issues/759`) into the message input field.
        g. Use `browser_send_keys` with "Enter" to send the message.
        h. After sending the message, verify its presence in the chat history (if possible) or proceed to the next user.
128. | ================================================== USER MESSAGE ==================================================
The current subtask has already been attempted 2 times but remains unresolved.  
Do not simply retry the same approach. Carefully review all available task information and execution history, identify why previous attempts failed, and propose a new angle or breakthrough strategy.  
Update the next subtask with a clear, revised plan that has a higher chance of success.  

Always remember that your ultimate goal is to complete task:
<task>
Navigate to http://the-agent-company.com:8929/root/bustub/-/issues/759. There is instruction about a project called HyperLogLog algorithm.

* You need to distribute the project information to all the database group members in Rocketchat. Do not send the 
message directly in the group chat; instead, send private message to each of the members.
* You do this by sending the link to the project to them

You could find the RocketChat website at http://the-agent-company.com:3000/
</task>
129. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================
* The information you know and have obtained is:
    1. The main objective is to distribute information about the "HyperLogLog algorithm" project to all database group members in Rocketchat.
    2. The project information (link) is: http://the-agent-company.com:8929/root/bustub/-/issues/759.
    3. The distribution method must be private messages to each member, not a group chat.
    4. The content of the private message is the project link.
    5. The Rocketchat website URL is: http://the-agent-company.com:3000/.
    6. I have successfully accessed the GitLab project page and confirmed its content.
    7. I have successfully logged into Rocketchat.
    8. The identified database group members (usernames) are: `alex_turner`, `chen_xinyi`, `david_wong`, `emily_zhou`, `emma_lewis`, `huang_jie`, `jessica_chen`, `jessica_lee`, `li_ming`, `liu_qiang`, `mark_johnson`, `mike_chen`, `priya_sharma`, `sarah_johnson`, `sophia_rodriguez`, `wang_fang`, `zhang_wei`. (Total 17 users).
    9. Messages have been successfully sent to `alex_turner`, `chen_xinyi`, `david_wong`, `emily_zhou`, `emma_lewis`, and `huang_jie`. (6 users).
    10. There are still 11 users remaining to whom the message needs to be sent: `jessica_chen`, `jessica_lee`, `li_ming`, `liu_qiang`, `mark_johnson`, `mike_chen`, `priya_sharma`, `sarah_johnson`, `sophia_rodriguez`, `wang_fang`, `zhang_wei`.
    11. Previous attempts to automate the message sending using a Python script failed because browser interaction functions are tools and must be called explicitly via `<tool_call>` actions, not directly within Python code.
    12. The current strategy involves manually executing the sequence of browser actions for each remaining user.
    13. The sequence of actions for each user is:
        a. Navigate to the RocketChat home page (`http://the-agent-company.com:3000/home`).
        b. Click the search button (index 5 from previous observations).
        c. Input the target username into the search field (index 4 from previous observations).
        d. Click on the search result corresponding to the user (index 7 from previous observations).
        e. Input the GitLab project link into the message input field (index varies, needs to be re-evaluated each time).
        f. Use `browser_send_keys` with "Enter" to send the message.
    14. It is crucial to use `browser_wait_and_get_update()` before each interactive step to get the latest interactive elements and their accurate indices due to UI volatility.

* The task can be divided into the following subtasks:
    1. Send_Message_to_Jessica_Chen: Successfully send the GitLab project link to 'jessica_chen' via private message in Rocketchat.
    2. Send_Message_to_Jessica_Lee: Successfully send the GitLab project link to 'jessica_lee' via private message in Rocketchat.
    3. Send_Message_to_Li_Ming: Successfully send the GitLab project link to 'li_ming' via private message in Rocketchat.
    4. Send_Message_to_Liu_Qiang: Successfully send the GitLab project link to 'liu_qiang' via private message in Rocketchat.
    5. Send_Message_to_Mark_Johnson: Successfully send the GitLab project link to 'mark_johnson' via private message in Rocketchat.
    6. Send_Message_to_Mike_Chen: Successfully send the GitLab project link to 'mike_chen' via private message in Rocketchat.
    7. Send_Message_to_Priya_Sharma: Successfully send the GitLab project link to 'priya_sharma' via private message in Rocketchat.
    8. Send_Message_to_Sarah_Johnson: Successfully send the GitLab project link to 'sarah_johnson' via private message in Rocketchat.
    9. Send_Message_to_Sophia_Rodriguez: Successfully send the GitLab project link to 'sophia_rodriguez' via private message in Rocketchat.
    10. Send_Message_to_Wang_Fang: Successfully send the GitLab project link to 'wang_fang' via private message in Rocketchat.
    11. Send_Message_to_Zhang_Wei: Successfully send the GitLab project link to 'zhang_wei' via private message in Rocketchat.

## Verification Report for Subtask: Send_Message_to_Jessica_Chen

**Title**: Verification of GitLab Project Link Sent to Jessica Chen

**Checklist Details**:

1.  **Verify_Message_Sent_to_Jessica_Chen**:
    *   **Goal**: Confirm that the GitLab project link (http://the-agent-company.com:8929/root/bustub/-/issues/759) is present in the 'webpage accessibility tree' within the direct message conversation for 'jessica_chen', following the message send action.
    *   **Outcome**: **PASSED**. The `webpage accessibility tree` in step 23 clearly shows a `link` element with the URL `http://the-agent-company.com:8929/root/bustub/-/issues/759` embedded within a `paragraph` element. This directly confirms that the specified project link was successfully sent to 'jessica_chen' and is visible in the chat history.

**Conclusion**:
The Subtask "Send_Message_to_Jessica_Chen" is **complete**. The Task Agent successfully sent the GitLab project link to 'jessica_chen', as confirmed by its presence in the Rocketchat direct message conversation's accessibility tree.
</check_report>

The Check Agent reports that the current Subtask has been completed. The above is the check report from the Check Agent.

155. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================
Got it! I'll continue with the task.
156. | ================================================== USER MESSAGE ==================================================
The current subtask has been successfully completed, and substantial new information has been obtained.  
Carefully review the updated context and determine how this new knowledge impacts the overall task progress.  
Design the next subtask to effectively leverage these insights and move closer to completing the full task.

Always remember that your ultimate goal is to complete task:
<task>
Navigate to http://the-agent-company.com:8929/root/bustub/-/issues/759. There is instruction about a project called HyperLogLog algorithm.

* You need to distribute the project information to all the database group members in Rocketchat. Do not send the 
message directly in the group chat; instead, send private message to each of the members.
* You do this by sending the link to the project to them

You could find the RocketChat website at http://the-agent-company.com:3000/
</task>
157. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================
* The information you know and have obtained is:
    1. The main objective is to distribute information about the "HyperLogLog algorithm" project to all database group members in Rocketchat.
    2. The project information (link) is: http://the-agent-company.com:8929/root/bustub/-/issues/759.
    3. The distribution method must be private messages to each member, not a group chat.
    4. The content of the private message is the project link.
    5. The Rocketchat website URL is: http://the-agent-company.com:3000/.
    6. The GitLab issue page has been successfully accessed and its content confirmed.
    7. I have successfully logged into Rocketchat.
    8. The identified database group members (usernames) are: `alex_turner`, `chen_xinyi`, `david_wong`, `emily_zhou`, `emma_lewis`, `huang_jie`, `jessica_chen`, `jessica_lee`, `li_ming`, `liu_qiang`, `mark_johnson`, `mike_chen`, `priya_sharma`, `sarah_johnson`, `sophia_rodriguez`, `wang_fang`, `zhang_wei`. (Total 17 users).
    9. Messages have been successfully sent to the following 7 users: `alex_turner`, `chen_xinyi`, `david_wong`, `emily_zhou`, `emma_lewis`, `huang_jie`, and `jessica_chen`.
    10. There are still 10 users remaining to whom the message needs to be sent: `jessica_lee`, `li_ming`, `liu_qiang`, `mark_johnson`, `mike_chen`, `priya_sharma`, `sarah_johnson`, `sophia_rodriguez`, `wang_fang`, `zhang_wei`.
    11. Previous attempts to automate the message sending using a Python script failed because browser interaction functions are tools and must be called explicitly via `<tool_call>` actions, not directly within Python code.
    12. The current successful strategy involves manually executing the sequence of browser actions for each user to ensure proper interaction with dynamic UI elements.
    13. The general sequence of actions for sending a message to each user is: navigate to home page, click search button, input username, click on user's direct message link in search results, input project link into message field, and send the message.
    14. `browser_wait_and_get_update()` should be used before each interactive step to get the latest interactive elements and their accurate indices due to UI volatility.

* The task can be divided into the following subtasks:
    1. Send_Message_to_Jessica_Lee: Successfully send the GitLab project link to 'jessica_lee' via private message in Rocketchat.
    2. Send_Message_to_Li_Ming: Successfully send the GitLab project link to 'li_ming' via private message in Rocketchat.
    3. Send_Message_to_Liu_Qiang: Successfully send the GitLab project link to 'liu_qiang' via private message in Rocketchat.
    4. Send_Message_to_Mark_Johnson: Successfully send the GitLab project link to 'mark_johnson' via private message in Rocketchat.
    5. Send_Message_to_Mike_Chen: Successfully send the GitLab project link to 'mike_chen' via private message in Rocketchat.
    6. Send_Message_to_Priya_Sharma: Successfully send the GitLab project link to 'priya_sharma' via private message in Rocketchat.
    7. Send_Message_to_Sarah_Johnson: Successfully send the GitLab project link to 'sarah_johnson' via private message in Rocketchat.
    8. Send_Message_to_Sophia_Rodriguez: Successfully send the GitLab project link to 'sophia_rodriguez' via private message in Rocketchat.
    9. Send_Message_to_Wang_Fang: Successfully send the GitLab project link to 'wang_fang' via private message in Rocketchat.
    10. Send_Message_to_Zhang_Wei: Successfully send the GitLab project link to 'zhang_wei' via private message in Rocketchat.
    11. Verify_All_Messages_Sent: Confirm that the GitLab project link has been successfully sent to all identified database group members in Rocketchat.

The current subtask has been successfully completed, and substantial new information has been obtained.  
Carefully review the updated context and determine how this new knowledge impacts the overall task progress.  
Design the next subtask to effectively leverage these insights and move closer to completing the full task.

Always remember that your ultimate goal is to complete task:
<task>
Navigate to http://the-agent-company.com:8929/root/bustub/-/issues/759. There is instruction about a project called HyperLogLog algorithm.

* You need to distribute the project information to all the database group members in Rocketchat. Do not send the 
message directly in the group chat; instead, send private message to each of the members.
* You do this by sending the link to the project to them

You could find the RocketChat website at http://the-agent-company.com:3000/
</task>
175. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================
* The information you know and have obtained is:
    1. The main objective is to distribute information about the "HyperLogLog algorithm" project to all database group members in Rocketchat.
    2. The project information (link) is: http://the-agent-company.com:8929/root/bustub/-/issues/759.
    3. The distribution method must be private messages to each member, not a group chat.
    4. The content of the private message is the project link.
    5. The Rocketchat website URL is: http://the-agent-company.com:3000/.
    6. The GitLab issue page has been successfully accessed and its content confirmed.
    7. I have successfully logged into Rocketchat.
    8. The identified database group members (usernames) are: `alex_turner`, `chen_xinyi`, `david_wong`, `emily_zhou`, `emma_lewis`, `huang_jie`, `jessica_chen`, `jessica_lee`, `li_ming`, `liu_qiang`, `mark_johnson`, `mike_chen`, `priya_sharma`, `sarah_johnson`, `sophia_rodriguez`, `wang_fang`, `zhang_wei`. (Total 17 users).
    9. Messages have been successfully sent to the following 8 users: `alex_turner`, `chen_xinyi`, `david_wong`, `emily_zhou`, `emma_lewis`, `huang_jie`, `jessica_chen`, and `jessica_lee`.
    10. There are still 9 users remaining to whom the message needs to be sent: `li_ming`, `liu_qiang`, `mark_johnson`, `mike_chen`, `priya_sharma`, `sarah_johnson`, `sophia_rodriguez`, `wang_fang`, `zhang_wei`.
    11. Previous attempts to automate the message sending using a Python script failed because browser interaction functions are tools and must be called explicitly via `<tool_call>` actions, not directly within Python code.
    12. The current successful strategy involves manually executing the sequence of browser actions for each user to ensure proper interaction with dynamic UI elements.
    13. The general sequence of actions for sending a message to each user is: navigate to home page, click search button, input username, click on user's direct message link in search results, input project link into message field, and send the message.
    14. `browser_wait_and_get_update()` should be used before each interactive step to get the latest interactive elements and their accurate indices due to UI volatility.

* The task can be divided into the following subtasks:
    1. Send_Message_to_Li_Ming: Successfully send the GitLab project link to 'li_ming' via private message in Rocketchat.
    2. Send_Message_to_Liu_Qiang: Successfully send the GitLab project link to 'liu_qiang' via private message in Rocketchat.
    3. Send_Message_to_Mark_Johnson: Successfully send the GitLab project link to 'mark_johnson' via private message in Rocketchat.

Thought: I have accessed the necessary guides. I am currently on the RocketChat home page (from the previous subtask's last action). I need to send a message to `li_ming`.

I will follow these steps:
1. Navigate to the RocketChat home page (already there).
2. Click the search button (index 5).
3. Input "li_ming" into the search field (index 4).
4. Click on "li_ming" in the search results (index 7).
5. Input the project link into the message input field (index needs to be re-evaluated).
6. Send the message using `browser_send_keys(keys="Enter")`.
7. Navigate back to the home page.

Starting with step 2: Click the search button. From the `webpage interactive elements` in the last observation (from the previous subtask), the search button is at index 5.
Action:
<tool_call>

If an `Element index does not exist` error is returned, it indicates extreme element volatility. **Always re-evaluate `webpage interactive elements` with `browser_wait_and_get_update` immediately before attempting a click, and crucially, confirm the element's `text` or `aria-label` attribute semantically matches the intended target.** If direct clicking by index proves unreliable, *especially within dynamic lists or sidebars (e.g., chat contact lists)*, consider alternative strategies like using an application's built-in search functionality or `browser_go_to_url` if a direct link is known, rather than repeatedly retrying. For form submissions or general action triggers, `browser_send_keys` with 'Enter' is a more robust alternative and **highly recommended for reliability**.

Got it! I'll continue with the task.
210. | ================================================== USER MESSAGE ==================================================
The current subtask has been successfully completed, and substantial new information has been obtained.  
Carefully review the updated context and determine how this new knowledge impacts the overall task progress.  
Design the next subtask to effectively leverage these insights and move closer to completing the full task.

Always remember that your ultimate goal is to complete task:
<task>
Navigate to http://the-agent-company.com:8929/root/bustub/-/issues/759. There is instruction about a project called HyperLogLog algorithm.

* You need to distribute the project information to all the database group members in Rocketchat. Do not send the 
message directly in the group chat; instead, send private message to each of the members.
* You do this by sending the link to the project to them

You could find the RocketChat website at http://the-agent-company.com:3000/
</task>
211. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================
* The information you know and have obtained is:
    1. The main objective is to distribute information about the "HyperLogLog algorithm" project to all database group members in Rocketchat.
    2. The project information (link) is: http://the-agent-company.com:8929/root/bustub/-/issues/759.
    3. The distribution method must be private messages to each member, not a group chat.
    4. The content of the private message is the project link.
    5. The Rocketchat website URL is: http://the-agent-company.com:3000/.
    6. The GitLab issue page has been successfully accessed and its content confirmed.
    7. I have successfully logged into Rocketchat.
    8. The identified database group members (usernames) are: `alex_turner`, `chen_xinyi`, `david_wong`, `emily_zhou`, `emma_lewis`, `huang_jie`, `jessica_chen`, `jessica_lee`, `li_ming`, `liu_qiang`, `mark_johnson`, `mike_chen`, `priya_sharma`, `sarah_johnson`, `sophia_rodriguez`, `wang_fang`, `zhang_wei`. (Total 17 users).
    9. Messages have been successfully sent to the following 9 users: `alex_turner`, `chen_xinyi`, `david_wong`, `emily_zhou`, `emma_lewis`, `huang_jie`, `jessica_chen`, `jessica_lee`, and `li_ming`.
    10. There are still 8 users remaining to whom the message needs to be sent: `liu_qiang`, `mark_johnson`, `mike_chen`, `priya_sharma`, `sarah_johnson`, `sophia_rodriguez`, `wang_fang`, `zhang_wei`. (Wait, I just sent a message to liu_qiang. The list of already messaged users is now 10, so remaining users is 7).
    11. **Correction:** Messages have been successfully sent to the following 10 users: `alex_turner`, `chen_xinyi`, `david_wong`, `emily_zhou`, `emma_lewis`, `huang_jie`, `jessica_chen`, `jessica_lee`, `li_ming`, and `liu_qiang`.
    12. There are still 7 users remaining to whom the message needs to be sent: `mark_johnson`, `mike_chen`, `priya_sharma`, `sarah_johnson`, `sophia_rodriguez`, `wang_fang`, `zhang_wei`.
    13. Previous attempts to automate the message sending using a Python script failed because browser interaction functions are tools and must be called explicitly via `<tool_call>` actions, not directly within Python code.
    14. The current successful strategy involves manually executing the sequence of browser actions for each user to ensure proper interaction with dynamic UI elements.
    15. The general sequence of actions for sending a message to each user is: navigate to home page, click search button, input username, click on user's direct message link in search results, input project link into message field, and send the message.
    16. `browser_wait_and_get_update()` should be used before each interactive step to get the latest interactive elements and their accurate indices due to UI volatility.

* The task can be divided into the following subtasks:
    1. Send_Message_to_Mark_Johnson: Successfully send the GitLab project link to 'mark_johnson' via private message in Rocketchat.
    2. Send_Message_to_Mike_Chen: Successfully send the GitLab project link to 'mike_chen' via private message in Rocketchat.
    3. Send_Message_to_Priya_Sharma: Successfully send the GitLab project link to 'priya_sharma' via private message in Rocketchat.
    4. Send_Message_to_Sarah_Johnson: Successfully send the GitLab project link to 'sarah_johnson' via private message in Rocketchat.
    5. Send_Message_to_Sophia_Rodriguez: Successfully send the GitLab project link to 'sophia_rodriguez' via private message in Rocketchat.
    6. Send_Message_to_Wang_Fang: Successfully send the GitLab project link to 'wang_fang' via private message in Rocketchat.
    7. Send_Message_to_Zhang_Wei: Successfully send the GitLab project link to 'zhang_wei' via private message in Rocketchat.
    8. Verify_All_Messages_Sent: Confirm that the GitLab project link has been successfully sent to all identified database group members in Rocketchat.

**Title**: Verification of GitLab Project Link Sent to Mark Johnson

**Checklist Details**:

1.  **Verify_Message_Sent_to_Mark_Johnson**:
    *   **Goal**: Confirm that the GitLab project link (http://the-agent-company.com:8929/root/bustub/-/issues/759) is present in the 'webpage accessibility tree' within the direct message conversation for 'mark_johnson', following the message send action.
    *   **Outcome**: **PASSED**. The `webpage accessibility tree` in step 13 clearly shows a `link` element with the URL `http://the-agent-company.com:8929/root/bustub/-/issues/759` embedded within a `paragraph` element. This directly confirms that the specified project link was successfully sent to 'mark_johnson' and is visible in the chat history.

**Conclusion**:
The Subtask "Send_Message_to_Mark_Johnson" is **complete**. The Task Agent successfully sent the GitLab project link to 'mark_johnson', as confirmed by its presence in the Rocketchat direct message conversation's accessibility tree.

Carefully review the updated context and determine how this new knowledge impacts the overall task progress.  
Design the next subtask to effectively leverage these insights and move closer to completing the full task.

Always remember that your ultimate goal is to complete task:
<task>
Navigate to http://the-agent-company.com:8929/root/bustub/-/issues/759. There is instruction about a project called HyperLogLog algorithm.

* You need to distribute the project information to all the database group members in Rocketchat. Do not send the 
message directly in the group chat; instead, send private message to each of the members.
* You do this by sending the link to the project to them

You could find the RocketChat website at http://the-agent-company.com:3000/

* The information you know and have obtained is:
    1. The main objective is to distribute information about the "HyperLogLog algorithm" project to all database group members in Rocketchat.
    2. The project information (link) is: http://the-agent-company.com:8929/root/bustub/-/issues/759.
    3. The distribution method must be private messages to each member, not a group chat.
    4. The content of the private message is the project link.
    5. The Rocketchat website URL is: http://the-agent-company.com:3000/.
    6. The GitLab issue page has been successfully accessed and its content confirmed.
    7. I have successfully logged into Rocketchat.
    8. The identified database group members (usernames) are: `alex_turner`, `chen_xinyi`, `david_wong`, `emily_zhou`, `emma_lewis`, `huang_jie`, `jessica_chen`, `jessica_lee`, `li_ming`, `liu_qiang`, `mark_johnson`, `mike_chen`, `priya_sharma`, `sarah_johnson`, `sophia_rodriguez`, `wang_fang`, `zhang_wei`. (Total 17 users).
    9. Messages have been successfully sent to the following 11 users: `alex_turner`, `chen_xinyi`, `david_wong`, `emily_zhou`, `emma_lewis`, `huang_jie`, `jessica_chen`, `jessica_lee`, `li_ming`, `liu_qiang`, and `mark_johnson`.
    10. There are still 6 users remaining to whom the message needs to be sent: `mike_chen`, `priya_sharma`, `sarah_johnson`, `sophia_rodriguez`, `wang_fang`, `zhang_wei`.
    11. Previous attempts to automate the message sending using a Python script failed because browser interaction functions are tools and must be called explicitly via `<tool_call>` actions, not directly within Python code.
    12. The current successful strategy involves manually executing the sequence of browser actions for each user to ensure proper interaction with dynamic UI elements.
    13. The general sequence of actions for sending a message to each user is: navigate to home page, click search button, input username, click on user's direct message link in search results, input project link into message field, and send the message.
    14. `browser_wait_and_get_update()` should be used before each interactive step to get the latest interactive elements and their accurate indices due to UI volatility.

* The task can be divided into the following subtasks:
    1. Send_Message_to_Mike_Chen: Successfully send the GitLab project link to 'mike_chen' via private message in Rocketchat.
    2. Send_Message_to_Priya_Sharma: Successfully send the GitLab project link to 'priya_sharma' via private message in Rocketchat.
    3. Send_Message_to_Sarah_Johnson: Successfully send the GitLab project link to 'sarah_johnson' via private message in Rocketchat.
    4. Send_Message_to_Sophia_Rodriguez: Successfully send the GitLab project link to 'sophia_rodriguez' via private message in Rocketchat.
    5. Send_Message_to_Wang_Fang: Successfully send the GitLab project link to 'wang_fang' via private message in Rocketchat.
    6. Send_Message_to_Zhang_Wei: Successfully send the GitLab project link to 'zhang_wei' via private message in Rocketchat.
    7. Verify_All_Messages_Sent: Confirm that the GitLab project link has been successfully sent to all identified database group members in Rocketchat.

233. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================
Thought: I have accessed the necessary guides. I am currently on the RocketChat home page (from the previous subtask's last action, which was navigating to home). I need to send a message to `mike_chen`.

I will follow these steps:
1. Navigate to the RocketChat home page (already there).
2. Click the search button (index 5).
3. Input "mike_chen" into the search field (index 4).
4. Click on "mike_chen" in the search results (index 7).
5. Input the project link into the message input field (index needs to be re-evaluated).
6. Send the message using `browser_send_keys(keys="Enter")`.
7. Navigate back to the home page.

Starting with step 2: Click the search button. From the `webpage interactive elements` in the last observation (from the previous subtask, before the current guide access step), the search button is at index 5.
Action:
<tool_call>

</tool_response>
<tool_instruction>
If an `Element index does not exist` error is returned, it indicates extreme element volatility. **Always re-evaluate `webpage interactive elements` with `browser_wait_and_get_update` immediately before attempting a click, and crucially, confirm the element's `text` or `aria-label` attribute semantically matches the intended target.** If direct clicking by index proves unreliable, *especially within dynamic lists or sidebars (e.g., chat contact lists)*, consider alternative strategies like using an application's built-in search functionality or `browser_go_to_url` if a direct link is known, rather than repeatedly retrying. For form submissions or general action triggers, `browser_send_keys` with 'Enter' is a more robust alternative and **highly recommended for reliability**.
</tool_instruction>

235. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================
Thought: I have clicked the search button, but I am still in a direct message with `mark_johnson`. This means the search overlay appeared on top of the current chat. I need to go back to the home page to ensure I'm starting from a clean state before searching for the next user.

## Verification Report for Subtask: Send_Message_to_Priya_Sharma

**Title**: Verification of GitLab Project Link Sent to Priya Sharma

**Checklist Details**:

1.  **Verify_Message_Sent_to_Priya_Sharma**:
    *   **Goal**: Confirm that the GitLab project link (http://the-agent-company.com:8929/root/bustub/-/issues/759) is present in the 'webpage accessibility tree' within the direct message conversation for 'priya_sharma', following the message send action.
    *   **Outcome**: **PASSED**. The `webpage accessibility tree` in step 13 clearly shows a `link` element with the URL `http://the-agent-company.com:8929/root/bustub/-/issues/759` embedded within a `paragraph` element. This directly confirms that the specified project link was successfully sent to 'priya_sharma' and is visible in the chat history.

**Conclusion**:
The Subtask "Send_Message_to_Priya_Sharma" is **complete**. The Task Agent successfully sent the GitLab project link to 'priya_sharma', as confirmed by its presence in the Rocketchat direct message conversation's accessibility tree.
</check_report>

The Check Agent reports that the current Subtask has been completed. The above is the check report from the Check Agent.

267. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================
Got it! I'll continue with the task.
268. | ================================================== USER MESSAGE ==================================================
The current subtask has been successfully completed, and substantial new information has been obtained.  
Carefully review the updated context and determine how this new knowledge impacts the overall task progress.  
Design the next subtask to effectively leverage these insights and move closer to completing the full task.

Always remember that your ultimate goal is to complete task:
<task>
Navigate to http://the-agent-company.com:8929/root/bustub/-/issues/759. There is instruction about a project called HyperLogLog algorithm.

* You need to distribute the project information to all the database group members in Rocketchat. Do not send the 
message directly in the group chat; instead, send private message to each of the members.
* You do this by sending the link to the project to them

You could find the RocketChat website at http://the-agent-company.com:3000/
</task>
269. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================
* The information you know and have obtained is:
    1. The main objective is to distribute information about the "HyperLogLog algorithm" project to all database group members in Rocketchat.
    2. The project information (link) is: http://the-agent-company.com:8929/root/bustub/-/issues/759.
    3. The distribution method must be private messages to each member, not a group chat.
    4. The content of the private message is the project link.
    5. The Rocketchat website URL is: http://the-agent-company.com:3000/.
    6. The GitLab issue page has been successfully accessed and its content confirmed.
    7. I have successfully logged into Rocketchat.
    8. The identified database group members (usernames) are: `alex_turner`, `chen_xinyi`, `david_wong`, `emily_zhou`, `emma_lewis`, `huang_jie`, `jessica_chen`, `jessica_lee`, `li_ming`, `liu_qiang`, `mark_johnson`, `mike_chen`, `priya_sharma`, `sarah_johnson`, `sophia_rodriguez`, `wang_fang`, `zhang_wei`. (Total 17 users).
    9. Messages have been successfully sent to the following 13 users: `alex_turner`, `chen_xinyi`, `david_wong`, `emily_zhou`, `emma_lewis`, `huang_jie`, `jessica_chen`, `jessica_lee`, `li_ming`, `liu_qiang`, `mark_johnson`, `mike_chen`, and `priya_sharma`.
    10. There are still 4 users remaining to whom the message needs to be sent: `sarah_johnson`, `sophia_rodriguez`, `wang_fang`, `zhang_wei`.
    11. Previous attempts to automate the message sending using a Python script failed because browser interaction functions are tools and must be called explicitly via `<tool_call>` actions, not directly within Python code.
    12. The current successful strategy involves manually executing the sequence of browser actions for each user to ensure proper interaction with dynamic UI elements.
    13. The general sequence of actions for sending a message to each user is: navigate to home page, click search button, input username, click on user's direct message link in search results, input project link into message field, and send the message.
    14. `browser_wait_and_get_update()` should be used before each interactive step to get the latest interactive elements and their accurate indices due to UI volatility.
    15. The observed indices for key interactive elements have been consistent across multiple message sending operations:
        *   Search button: index 5
        *   Search input field: index 4
        *   User's direct message link in search results: index 7
        *   Message input field: index varies, but has been observed (e.g., 72, 80, 88, 96, 104, 112, 120, 128, 136, 144, 152 in previous steps). This index needs to be re-evaluated for each new user's chat.

* The task can be divided into the following subtasks:
    1. Send_Message_to_Sarah_Johnson: Successfully send the GitLab project link to 'sarah_johnson' via private message in Rocketchat.
    2. Send_Message_to_Sophia_Rodriguez: Successfully send the GitLab project link to 'sophia_rodriguez' via private message in Rocketchat.
    3. Send_Message_to_Wang_Fang: Successfully send the GitLab project link to 'wang_fang' via private message in Rocketchat.
    4. Send_Message_to_Zhang_Wei: Successfully send the GitLab project link to 'zhang_wei' via private message in Rocketchat.
    5. Verify_All_Messages_Sent: Confirm that the GitLab project link has been successfully sent to all identified database group members in Rocketchat.

    1. The main objective is to distribute information about the "HyperLogLog algorithm" project to all database group members in Rocketchat.
    2. The project information (link) is: http://the-agent-company.com:8929/root/bustub/-/issues/759.
    3. The distribution method must be private messages to each member, not a group chat.
    4. The content of the private message is the project link.
    5. The Rocketchat website URL is: http://the-agent-company.com:3000/.
    6. The GitLab issue page has been successfully accessed and its content confirmed.
    7. I have successfully logged into Rocketchat.
    8. The identified database group members (usernames) are: `alex_turner`, `chen_xinyi`, `david_wong`, `emily_zhou`, `emma_lewis`, `huang_jie`, `jessica_chen`, `jessica_lee`, `li_ming`, `liu_qiang`, `mark_johnson`, `mike_chen`, `priya_sharma`, `sarah_johnson`, `sophia_rodriguez`, `wang_fang`, `zhang_wei`. (Total 17 users).
    9. Messages have been successfully sent to the following 14 users: `alex_turner`, `chen_xinyi`, `david_wong`, `emily_zhou`, `emma_lewis`, `huang_jie`, `jessica_chen`, `jessica_lee`, `li_ming`, `liu_qiang`, `mark_johnson`, `mike_chen`, `priya_sharma`, and `sarah_johnson`.
    10. There are still 3 users remaining to whom the message needs to be sent: `sophia_rodriguez`, `wang_fang`, `zhang_wei`.
    11. Previous attempts to automate the message sending using a Python script failed because browser interaction functions are tools and must be called explicitly via `<tool_call>` actions, not directly within Python code.
    12. The current successful strategy involves manually executing the sequence of browser actions for each user to ensure proper interaction with dynamic UI elements.
    13. The general sequence of actions for sending a message to each user is: navigate to home page, click search button, input username, click on user's direct message link in search results, input project link into message field, and send the message.
    14. `browser_wait_and_get_update()` should be used before each interactive step to get the latest interactive elements and their accurate indices due to UI volatility.

* The task can be divided into the following subtasks:
    1. Send_Message_to_Sophia_Rodriguez: Successfully send the GitLab project link to 'sophia_rodriguez' via private message in Rocketchat.
    2. Send_Message_to_Wang_Fang: Successfully send the GitLab project link to 'wang_fang' via private message in Rocketchat.
    3. Send_Message_to_Zhang_Wei: Successfully send the GitLab project link to 'zhang_wei' via private message in Rocketchat.
    4. Verify_All_Messages_Sent: Confirm that the GitLab project link has been successfully sent to all identified database group members in Rocketchat.

Thought: I have accessed the necessary guides. I am currently on the RocketChat home page (from the previous subtask's last action, which was navigating to home). I need to send a message to `sophia_rodriguez`.

I will follow these steps:
1. Navigate to the RocketChat home page (already there).
2. Click the search button (index 5).
3. Input "sophia_rodriguez" into the search field (index 4).
4. Click on "sophia_rodriguez" in the search results (index 7).
5. Input the project link into the message input field (index needs to be re-evaluated).
6. Send the message using `browser_send_keys(keys="Enter")`.
7. Navigate back to the home page.

Starting with step 2: Click the search button. From the `webpage interactive elements` in the last observation (from the previous subtask, before the current guide access step), the search button is at index 5.

Thought: I have accessed the necessary guides. I am currently on the RocketChat home page (from the previous subtask's last action, which was navigating to home). I need to send a message to `wang_fang`.

I will follow these steps:
1. Navigate to the RocketChat home page (already there).
2. Click the search button (index 5).
3. Input "wang_fang" into the search field (index 4).
4. Click on "wang_fang" in the search results (index 7).
5. Input the project link into the message input field (index needs to be re-evaluated).
6. Send the message using `browser_send_keys(keys="Enter")`.
7. Navigate back to the home page.

Starting with step 2: Click the search button. From the `webpage interactive elements` in the last observation (from the previous subtask, before the current guide access step), the search button is at index 5.

Got it! I'll continue with the task.
324. | ================================================== USER MESSAGE ==================================================
The current subtask has been successfully completed, and substantial new information has been obtained.  
Carefully review the updated context and determine how this new knowledge impacts the overall task progress.  
Design the next subtask to effectively leverage these insights and move closer to completing the full task.

Always remember that your ultimate goal is to complete task:
<task>
Navigate to http://the-agent-company.com:8929/root/bustub/-/issues/759. There is instruction about a project called HyperLogLog algorithm.

* You need to distribute the project information to all the database group members in Rocketchat. Do not send the 
message directly in the group chat; instead, send private message to each of the members.
* You do this by sending the link to the project to them

You could find the RocketChat website at http://the-agent-company.com:3000/
</task>
325. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================
* The information you know and have obtained is:
    1. The main objective is to distribute information about the "HyperLogLog algorithm" project to all database group members in Rocketchat.
    2. The project information (link) is: http://the-agent-company.com:8929/root/bustub/-/issues/759.
    3. The distribution method must be private messages to each member, not a group chat.
    4. The content of the private message is the project link.
    5. The Rocketchat website URL is: http://the-agent-company.com:3000/.
    6. The GitLab issue page has been successfully accessed and its content confirmed.
    7. I have successfully logged into Rocketchat.
    8. The identified database group members (usernames) are: `alex_turner`, `chen_xinyi`, `david_wong`, `emily_zhou`, `emma_lewis`, `huang_jie`, `jessica_chen`, `jessica_lee`, `li_ming`, `liu_qiang`, `mark_johnson`, `mike_chen`, `priya_sharma`, `sarah_johnson`, `sophia_rodriguez`, `wang_fang`, `zhang_wei`. (Total 17 users).
    9. Messages have been successfully sent to the following 16 users: `alex_turner`, `chen_xinyi`, `david_wong`, `emily_zhou`, `emma_lewis`, `huang_jie`, `jessica_chen`, `jessica_lee`, `li_ming`, `liu_qiang`, `mark_johnson`, `mike_chen`, `priya_sharma`, `sarah_johnson`, `sophia_rodriguez`, and `wang_fang`.
    10. There is still 1 user remaining to whom the message needs to be sent: `zhang_wei`.
    11. Previous attempts to automate the message sending using a Python script failed because browser interaction functions are tools and must be called explicitly via `<tool_call>` actions, not directly within Python code.
    12. The current successful strategy involves manually executing the sequence of browser actions for each user to ensure proper interaction with dynamic UI elements.
    13. The general sequence of actions for sending a message to each user is: navigate to home page, click search button, input username, click on user's direct message link in search results, input project link into message field, and send the message.
    14. `browser_wait_and_get_update()` should be used before each interactive step to get the latest interactive elements and their accurate indices due to UI volatility.

* The task can be divided into the following subtasks:
    1. Send_Message_to_Zhang_Wei: Successfully send the GitLab project link to 'zhang_wei' via private message in Rocketchat.
    2. Verify_All_Messages_Sent: Confirm that the GitLab project link has been successfully sent to all 17 identified database group members in Rocketchat.

    10. Previous attempts to automate the message sending using a Python script failed because browser interaction functions are tools and must be called explicitly via `<tool_call>` actions, not directly within Python code.
    11. The current successful strategy involved manually executing the sequence of browser actions for each user to ensure proper interaction with dynamic UI elements.
    12. The general sequence of actions for sending a message to each user was: navigate to home page, click search button, input username, click on user's direct message link in search results, input project link into message field, and send the message.
    13. `browser_wait_and_get_update()` was used before each interactive step to get the latest interactive elements and their accurate indices due to UI volatility.

* The task can be divided into the following subtasks:
    1. Verify_All_Messages_Sent: Confirm that the GitLab project link has been successfully sent to all 17 identified database group members in Rocketchat.
344. | ================================================== USER MESSAGE ==================================================
SubTask16: Verify_All_Messages_Sent
Goal: Confirm that the GitLab project link has been successfully sent to all 17 identified database group members in Rocketchat.
345. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================
Thought: The goal of this subtask is to confirm that the GitLab project link has been successfully sent to all 17 identified database group members. In the previous subtasks, I individually sent messages to each of the 17 users, and each of those subtasks was marked as complete after verifying that the message was sent and appeared in the respective chat history. Therefore, based on the successful completion of all individual message-sending subtasks, I can confirm that all messages have been sent.

There are no further actions needed to explicitly "verify" beyond the cumulative confirmation from the previous steps.
Final Answer: All 17 identified database group members (`alex_turner`, `chen_xinyi`, `david_wong`, `emily_zhou`, `emma_lewis`, `huang_jie`, `jessica_chen`, `jessica_lee`, `li_ming`, `liu_qiang`, `mark_johnson`, `mike_chen`, `priya_sharma`, `sarah_johnson`, `sophia_rodriguez`, `wang_fang`, `zhang_wei`) have successfully received the GitLab project link (http://the-agent-company.com:8929/root/bustub/-/issues/759) via private message in Rocketchat. This is confirmed by the successful completion and verification of each individual message-sending subtask.

  "report": "## Verification Report for Subtask: Verify_All_Messages_Sent\n\n**Title**: Verification of Comprehensive Message Delivery to All Database Group Members\n\n**Checklist Details**:\n\n1.  **Consolidate_Confirmed_Users**:\n    *   **Goal**: Extract all unique usernames from the 'check_report' of all individual 'Send_Message_to_X' subtasks (including the six users confirmed in the partially successful 'Send Private Message to Each Member' subtask) to compile a comprehensive list of all members for whom message sending was confirmed.\n    *   **Outcome**: **PASSED**. The consolidation successfully identified and listed all 17 users who received messages: `alex_turner`, `chen_xinyi`, `david_wong`, `emily_zhou`, `emma_lewis`, `huang_jie`, `jessica_chen`, `jessica_lee`, `li_ming`, `liu_qiang`, `mark_johnson`, `mike_chen`, `priya_sharma`, `sarah_johnson`, `sophia_rodriguez`, `wang_fang`, `zhang_wei`. This was confirmed by Python script execution output in the observation for CheckStep `Consolidate_Confirmed_Users`.\n\n2.  **Compare_with_Original_Member_List**:\n    *   **Goal**: Compare the consolidated list of confirmed users against the comprehensive list of 17 database group members identified in Subtask 3 ('Identify Database Group Members') to ensure that every member has a verified message delivery confirmation.\n    *   **Outcome**: **PASSED**. The consolidated list of 17 confirmed users exactly matches the comprehensive list of 17 database group members as stated in the `check_report` of Subtask 4 ('Send Private Message to Each Member'). This confirms that messages were successfully sent to all intended recipients.\n\n**Conclusion**:\nThe Subtask \"Verify_All_Messages_Sent\" is **complete**. All 17 identified database group members have successfully received the GitLab project link via private message in Rocketchat, as confirmed by the successful completion and verification of each individual message-sending subtask and the overall comparison of confirmed recipients against the total member list."

Please comprehensively review the entire task execution process, including all subtasks and the contextual information collected.  
Cross-check carefully against the overall task requirements:

1. **Completeness Check**: Ensure every aspect of the requirements has been addressed. Confirm that no items were skipped, postponed, or only partially completed.  
2. **Consistency Check**: Verify that all intermediate results are logically coherent and data-wise consistent with the final conclusions. There should be no contradictions, missing steps, or unexplained gaps.  
3. **Final Completion Confirmation**:  
   - If any requirements remain unfinished or results are insufficient, explicitly list the next subtasks to resolve them.  
   - If all requirements are fully and correctly met, return an empty task plan to indicate the task is completely finished.  

Always remember that your ultimate goal is to complete task:
<task>
Navigate to http://the-agent-company.com:8929/root/bustub/-/issues/759. There is instruction about a project called HyperLogLog algorithm.

* You need to distribute the project information to all the database group members in Rocketchat. Do not send the 
message directly in the group chat; instead, send private message to each of the members.
* You do this by sending the link to the project to them

You could find the RocketChat website at http://the-agent-company.com:3000/
