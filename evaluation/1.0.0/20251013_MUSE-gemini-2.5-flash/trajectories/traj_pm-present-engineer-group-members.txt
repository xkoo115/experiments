Complex shell features like command chaining (`&&`, `||`), pipes (`|`), I/O redirection (`>`, `>>`), and backgrounding (`&`) are often *not reliably interpreted by `run_cmd` directly* and can lead to unexpected behavior or errors (e.g., `SyntaxError`, `command not found`). For any non-trivial shell interaction or complex logic, *always prefer consolidating operations into a single Python script that uses `subprocess` for explicit control and robustness* over multiple `run_cmd` calls or complex shell syntax.** 3) Quote arguments containing spaces (`\"path with spaces\"`). 4) State changes (`cd`) do not persist across calls.", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"command": {"type": "string", "description": "shell command string."}}, "required": ["command"]}}}
</tools>

2. **Python Code Execution**
When executing Python code, please output:
<code>
... your code ...
</code>
- The working directory is `/workspace`
- Executing dangerous, destructive, or time-consuming code is prohibited.
- If both a **Tool Call** and **Python Code Execution** are included in the output, the tool call takes precedence, and the Python code will not be executed.
- Using outdated or limited python libraries may result in incomplete or inaccurate observations (e.g. missing images from PDFs or failing to extract key content). Always prefer robust, modern libraries to ensure full and reliable results.
- When performing file conversion or data extraction, always ensure **data integrity**. Verify that the structure, content, and critical fields of the source file are preserved in the output. Check row and column counts, headers, and key values before and after processing. **Avoid silent loss**, truncation, or unintended alteration of data.

## Action Execution Result Processing
- After each action is executed, an Observation is returned, which includes:
    1. `<tool_response>`: The result of the tool or code execution.
    2. `<tool_instruction>`: The instruction associated with a specific action, used to guide the next step or restrict subsequent behavior.
- **Note**: Do not fabricate observations.

## Security and Restrictions
- **Coding Actions (such as Python, CMD, etc.)**
    - Do not run high-risk operations that are large in code size or take a long time.
    - Do not execute code that could cause data loss, system damage, or irreversible changes.
    - Do not use the kill command with wildcards like * or other dangerous parameters that could result in a wide range of matches.
    - Prefer using the Python interpreter to execute code (safer and more efficient) rather than using the CMD tool.

> ⚠️ **Important**
> When your output contains content that fully conforms to the **Tool Call** or **Python Code Execution** format, the system will immediately parse, identify, and execute it as an **Action** without further confirmation and without reversal.
> Therefore, before outputting, always confirm that this is your **intended** action and fully assess the potential consequences and risks.
> If you are only using **quotes, demonstrations, or examples**, be sure to break the formatting or escape it to prevent the system from interpreting it as a real action.

# OBJECTIVE #
Your core objective is to independently and efficiently complete the tasks assigned to you by the company.


# MEMORY #
During previous tasks, you have accumulated the following reusable knowledge:

## Resolution Patterns
Comprehensive Contextualization: Systematically acquire and aggregate information from diverse, potentially unstructured sources, prioritizing local processing and cross-validation, to ensure a complete, coherent operational view and inform robust decisions.
Robust External Interaction: Prioritize stable, predictable interaction methods, such as structured APIs, and dynamically adapt strategies to ensure continuity and reliability with external systems despite their inconsistencies or volatility.
Adaptive Constraint Handling: When an objective is blocked by an unresolvable external constraint, acknowledge the limitation, perform necessary cleanup of partial artifacts, and adapt the strategy to proceed with viable data, avoiding unproductive retries.
Modular Resilient Design: Decompose operations into modular, decoupled units with explicit state management, to enhance predictability, isolate errors, improve maintainability, and ensure operational continuity.
Progressive Verification: Implement multi-stage validation, from granular checks within pipelines to comprehensive outcome validation, to localize errors, confirm system states, and ensure successful execution.

## Platform/Application Operation Guides
These guides summarize proven operation paths derived from past successful experiences.  
Each item is a structured reference designed to help you complete operations more quickly, accurately, and with reduced redundancy.

> This directory provides a comprehensive index of guides, compiling best practices and experience summaries for accomplishing various tasks.

### Recommended Usage Process
1. **Review the Guide First**  
   Before starting a task, browse the relevant entries in the directory to identify potentially useful guidance.  
2. **Targeted Access**  
   Use the `access_the_application_guide` tool to view detailed steps if necessary.  
3. **Reuse with Flexibility**  
   Apply past successful steps when they fit the current situation, but stay aware of possible mismatches.  
4. **Explore When Deviations Arise**  
   If the environment or results diverge from the guide, stop rigidly following it and explore alternative approaches through small, safe, and adaptive steps.

### Value of Guides
- Reduce task completion time by leveraging accumulated experience.  
- Lower error rates and avoid common pitfalls.  
- Ensure consistent, professional execution of tasks.  

### Guide Reliability & Adaptation
- Guides may be outdated, biased, or contain errors — they are “historical experience,” not absolute truth.  
- Use guides as starting points, not as strict rules.  
- When deviations or conflicts appear, **exit the guide and explore new paths** instead of persisting.  
- Record useful deviation points for later improvement of the guides.

Title: Subtask 2: Python Libraries Installation Verification Report

Checklist Details:
1.  **Check Goal: Verify that the `odfpy` library is installed.**
    *   **Action**: Attempted to import `odfpy` using Python code within the verification environment.
    *   **Observation**: The initial import attempt failed with `stdout: "odfpy import failed."`.
    *   **Action**: Subsequently executed `pip show odfpy` via `run_cmd` to verify its presence in the system where the Task Agent performed the installation.
    *   **Observation**: The `pip show odfpy` command returned `returncode: 0` and `stdout` clearly indicating `Name: odfpy Version: 1.4.1 ... Location: /usr/local/lib/python3.12/site-packages`. This confirms that `odfpy` was successfully installed by the Task Agent. The Task Agent's `pip install` command at step 04 also reported `returncode: 0`, confirming a successful installation from its perspective. The discrepancy in import success is attributed to differences in the Python execution environments (agent's system vs. verification environment).

2.  **Check Goal: Verify that the `python-pptx` library (imported as `pptx`) is installed.**
    *   **Action**: Executed Python code to import the `pptx` library.
    *   **Observation**: The import was successful, with `stdout: "pptx imported successfully."`.
    *   **Conclusion**: The `python-pptx` library is successfully installed and importable, directly confirming the Task Agent's reported success. The Task Agent's `pip install` command at step 04 also reported `returncode: 0`.

Conclusion:
The Subtask "Install Python Libraries for ODT and PPTX" is **complete**. Both `odfpy` and `python-pptx` libraries have been successfully installed in the environment accessible to the Task Agent.

SubTask3: Extract Engineer Information from ODT File
Goal: All engineer names and their roles are accurately extracted from the 'Personnell_File.odt' and structured into a usable format (e.g., a list of dictionaries).
49. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================
Thought: I need to extract engineer information from the `Personnell_File.odt` file. I have already installed the `odfpy` library, which is designed for this purpose. I will write a Python script to open the ODT file, read its content, and then extract the relevant engineer names and roles. I don't expect a direct guide for "Extracting data from ODT" in the `System` application, as it's a specific library usage. However, I will check `System: ReadFile` to see if there's any general guidance on reading files, though I anticipate needing to write custom Python code.

51. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================
Thought: The `ReadFile` guide is for plain text files, and `Personnell_File.odt` is an ODT file. Using `cat` would not yield readable content. I need to use the `odfpy` library that I previously installed to parse the ODT file. I will write a Python script to open the ODT file, extract its text content, and then process that text to identify engineer names and roles.

First, I need to understand the structure of the ODT file. I'll write a Python script to read the content of the ODT file and print it, which will help me determine how to extract the engineer information.

Thought: I have successfully extracted the raw text from the ODT file. Now I need to process this text to extract the names and roles of the engineers. I will write a Python script to parse the text, identify employees with "Engineer" in their role, and store their names and roles in a list of dictionaries.

The text format seems consistent:
`X. Name (Gender, Age)`
`- Role: Role Description`

I will iterate through the lines, looking for "Role:". Once found, I will extract the role and then look at the previous line to get the name. I will then filter for roles that contain "Engineer".

55. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================
Thought: The previous Python script extracted only the first names of the engineers. The task requires the full names. I need to modify the regular expression used to extract the name to capture the full name from the line format `X. Full Name (Gender, Age)`. The current regex `r'^\d+\.\s*([^ (]+)'` only captures the first word. A more appropriate regex would be `r'^\d+\.\s*(.*?)\s*\('` to capture everything between the number and the opening parenthesis, then strip any trailing spaces. I will also make sure to assign the `current_name` to `name_match.group(1).strip()`. I will also fix the hacky part for Jessica Chen, as the new regex should handle it if the name is extracted correctly.

Let's re-evaluate the name extraction logic:
The line `1. Sarah Johnson (Female, 42 years old)` should yield `Sarah Johnson`.
The regex `re.match(r'^\d+\.\s*(.*?)\s*\(', line)` would capture `Sarah Johnson`.

I will update the Python script accordingly.

Thought: The previous Python script successfully extracted most of the engineer information, but it missed "Sarah Johnson" who is the CTO. The filtering logic `if "Engineer" in role:` was too restrictive. I need to modify the script to include "CTO" as an engineering role. I will change the condition to `if "Engineer" in role or "CTO" in role:`. This will ensure that Sarah Johnson is also included in the extracted list.

Title: Subtask 3: Engineer Information Extraction Verification Report

Checklist Details:
1.  **Check Goal: Verify that the final output from the Task Agent (Observation 11) is a Python list of dictionaries, and each dictionary contains the keys 'name' and 'role'.**
    *   **Action**: Inspected the `stdout` content from Observation 11 of the Task Agent's trajectory.
    *   **Observation**: The `stdout` clearly showed a string representation of a Python list, where each item was a dictionary containing 'name' and 'role' keys. For instance, the first item is `{'name': 'Sarah Johnson', 'role': 'CTO'}`.
    *   **Conclusion**: The data structure is correct and meets the requirements.

2.  **Check Goal: Cross-reference the list of engineers extracted by the Task Agent (Observation 11) against the raw ODT content (Observation 05). Confirm that all individuals whose roles contain 'Engineer' or 'CTO' are present in the extracted list, and no non-engineers are mistakenly included.**
    *   **Action**: Manually compared the extracted engineer list from Observation 11 with the detailed personnel information provided in the raw ODT content from Observation 05.
    *   **Observation**: The extracted list includes: Sarah Johnson (CTO), Zhang Wei (Senior Software Engineer), Mike Chen (Senior Software Engineer), Emily Zhou (Software Engineer), Liu Qiang (Quality Assurance Engineer), Priya Sharma (Documentation Engineer), Alex Turner (Software Engineer), Emma Lewis (Software Engineer), and Jessica Chen (Frontend Software Engineer). All these individuals' roles, as per Observation 05, contain "Engineer" or "CTO". Conversely, individuals like Li Ming (Database Team Project Manager), Mark Johnson (Sales Director), etc., whose roles do not contain "Engineer" or "CTO", were correctly excluded from the list.
    *   **Conclusion**: The extracted list is complete and accurate according to the specified criteria ("Engineer" or "CTO" in role), including all relevant individuals and excluding all others.

3.  **Check Goal: For each engineer in the extracted list, verify that their 'name' and 'role' exactly match the corresponding full name and role description as presented in the raw ODT content (Observation 05), without truncation or alteration.**
    *   **Action**: Compared the 'name' and 'role' values for each dictionary in the extracted list (Observation 11) directly against the full names and role descriptions in the raw ODT content (Observation 05).
    *   **Observation**: For every entry, the 'name' (e.g., 'Sarah Johnson', 'Zhang Wei') and 'role' (e.g., 'CTO', 'Senior Software Engineer (Streaming Database Team)') exactly match the original text from the ODT file. No truncation, misspellings, or alterations were found.
    *   **Conclusion**: The names and roles extracted are consistent and accurate with the raw ODT content.

Conclusion:
The Subtask "Extract Engineer Information from ODT File" is **complete**. The Task Agent successfully extracted all engineer names and roles from the 'Personnell_File.odt' into a correctly structured and accurate list of dictionaries, adhering to the specified filtering criteria and maintaining data integrity.

    *   **Observation**: The command returned `returncode: 0` and `stdout: -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 35143 Sep 16 12:41 /workspace/engineers.pptx`. This confirms the file's existence and its path.
    *   **Conclusion**: The file 'engineers.pptx' exists as required.

2.  **Check Goal: Open the generated 'engineers.pptx' file and verify that it contains the correct number of slides, which should be equal to the number of engineers identified (9 slides).**
    *   **Action**: Executed Python code to open `engineers.pptx` using `python-pptx` and count the number of slides.
    *   **Observation**: The Python script outputted `stdout: "Number of slides in engineers.pptx: 9"`. This matches the 9 engineers identified in the previous subtask (Subtask 3), whose data was used to generate the presentation.
    *   **Conclusion**: The presentation contains the correct number of slides.

3.  **Check Goal: For each slide in 'engineers.pptx', verify that the slide title corresponds to an engineer's 'role' and the main text placeholder content corresponds to that engineer's 'name', cross-referencing with the `engineers_data` used by the Task Agent.**
    *   **Action**: Executed Python code to iterate through each slide of `engineers.pptx`, extract the title and body text, and compare them against the `engineers_data` list provided in the Task Agent's trajectory.
    *   **Observation**: The Python script outputted `stdout: "All slide contents (roles and names) match the expected data."`. This indicates that the content of each slide (title as role, body as name) accurately reflects the engineer data.
    *   **Conclusion**: The content of all slides is accurate and consistent with the expected engineer information.

Conclusion:
The Subtask "Generate Presentation Slides" is **complete**. The 'engineers.pptx' file has been successfully created in the `/workspace` directory, it contains the correct number of slides (9), and the content of each slide accurately displays the engineer's role and name as extracted in previous steps.

Replace `<target_name>` with the actual username or channel name. For channels, the search bar generally works with or without the '#' prefix. Successful navigation is verified by inspecting the `webpage accessibility tree` for the correct chat heading (e.g., `heading '<target_name>'`) and URL (e.g., `http://the-agent-company.com:3000/direct/<user_id>` or `http://the-agent-company.com:3000/channel/<channel_name>`).

If an obstructing sidebar (e.g., channel details) is open, it may need to be closed first (e.g., via `Browser: DismissOverlay`). Replace `<message_content>` with the actual message. Successful sending verified by observing `webpage accessibility tree` for the presence of a `paragraph` element containing the message content, typically preceded by `StaticText` for the sender username (e.g., `StaticText 'theagentcompany'`) and a timestamp (e.g., `StaticText '10:28 PM'`).
