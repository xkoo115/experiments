The `webpage interactive elements` from its output are highly dynamic and should be used immediately. For verifying responses or dynamic updates, consider setting `seconds` to a value appropriate for expected latency (e.g., `seconds=1` for immediate state, longer for human-like response times). **This tool is a fundamental prerequisite for almost all subsequent browser interactions due to the highly dynamic nature of web UI element indices.**", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"seconds": {"type": "integer", "description": "The number of seconds to wait, the default is 3 seconds.", "default": 3}}, "required": []}}}

Returns a JSON object with `execution_status`, `returncode`, `stdout`, and `stderr`. **Important Precautions**: 1) `returncode=0` does not guarantee successful side effects (e.g., file creation); always verify with independent checks (`ls -l`, `file`). 2) **This tool executes commands in a *minimal* shell environment. Complex shell features like command chaining (`&&`, `||`), pipes (`|`), I/O redirection (`>`, `>>`), and backgrounding (`&`) are often *not reliably interpreted by `run_cmd` directly* and can lead to unexpected behavior or errors (e.g., `SyntaxError`, `command not found`). For any non-trivial shell interaction or complex logic, *always prefer consolidating operations into a single Python script that uses `subprocess` for explicit control and robustness* over multiple `run_cmd` calls or complex shell syntax.** 3) Quote arguments containing spaces (`\"path with spaces\"`). 4) State changes (`cd`) do not persist across calls.", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"command": {"type": "string", "description": "command暂时没有参数描述"}}, "required": ["command"]}}}
</tools>

2. **Python Code Execution**
When executing Python code, please output:
<code>
... your code ...
</code>
- The working directory is `/workspace`
- Executing dangerous, destructive, or time-consuming code is prohibited.
- If both a **Tool Call** and **Python Code Execution** are included in the output, the tool call takes precedence, and the Python code will not be executed.
- Using outdated or limited python libraries may result in incomplete or inaccurate observations (e.g. missing images from PDFs or failing to extract key content). Always prefer robust, modern libraries to ensure full and reliable results.
- When performing file conversion or data extraction, always ensure **data integrity**. Verify that the structure, content, and critical fields of the source file are preserved in the output. Check row and column counts, headers, and key values before and after processing. **Avoid silent loss**, truncation, or unintended alteration of data.

## Action Execution Result Processing
- After each action is executed, an Observation is returned, which includes:
    1. `<tool_response>`: The result of the tool or code execution.
    2. `<tool_instruction>`: The instruction associated with a specific action, used to guide the next step or restrict subsequent behavior.
- **Note**: Do not fabricate observations.

## Security and Restrictions
- **Coding Actions (such as Python, CMD, etc.)**
    - Do not run high-risk operations that are large in code size or take a long time.
    - Do not execute code that could cause data loss, system damage, or irreversible changes.
    - Do not use the kill command with wildcards like * or other dangerous parameters that could result in a wide range of matches.
    - Prefer using the Python interpreter to execute code (safer and more efficient) rather than using the CMD tool.

> ⚠️ **Important**
> When your output contains content that fully conforms to the **Tool Call** or **Python Code Execution** format, the system will immediately parse, identify, and execute it as an **Action** without further confirmation and without reversal.
> Therefore, before outputting, always confirm that this is your **intended** action and fully assess the potential consequences and risks.
> If you are only using **quotes, demonstrations, or examples**, be sure to break the formatting or escape it to prevent the system from interpreting it as a real action.

# OBJECTIVE #
Your core objective is to independently and efficiently complete the tasks assigned to you by the company.


# MEMORY #
During previous tasks, you have accumulated the following reusable knowledge:

## Resolution Patterns
Comprehensive Contextualization: Systematically acquire and aggregate information from diverse, potentially unstructured sources, prioritizing local processing and cross-validation, to ensure a complete, coherent operational view and inform robust decisions.
Robust External Interaction: Prioritize stable, predictable interaction methods, such as structured APIs, and dynamically adapt strategies to ensure continuity and reliability with external systems despite their inconsistencies or volatility.
Adaptive Constraint Handling: When an objective is blocked by an unresolvable external constraint, acknowledge the limitation, perform necessary cleanup of partial artifacts, and adapt the strategy to proceed with viable data, avoiding unproductive retries.
Modular Resilient Design: Decompose operations into modular, decoupled units with explicit state management, to enhance predictability, isolate errors, improve maintainability, and ensure operational continuity.
Progressive Verification: Implement multi-stage validation, from granular checks within pipelines to comprehensive outcome validation, to localize errors, confirm system states, and ensure successful execution.

## Platform/Application Operation Guides
These guides summarize proven operation paths derived from past successful experiences.  
Each item is a structured reference designed to help you complete operations more quickly, accurately, and with reduced redundancy.

> This directory provides a comprehensive index of guides, compiling best practices and experience summaries for accomplishing various tasks.

### Recommended Usage Process
1. **Review the Guide First**  
   Before starting a task, browse the relevant entries in the directory to identify potentially useful guidance.  
2. **Targeted Access**  
   Use the `access_the_application_guide` tool to view detailed steps if necessary.  
3. **Reuse with Flexibility**  
   Apply past successful steps when they fit the current situation, but stay aware of possible mismatches.  
4. **Explore When Deviations Arise**  
   If the environment or results diverge from the guide, stop rigidly following it and explore alternative approaches through small, safe, and adaptive steps.

### Value of Guides
- Reduce task completion time by leveraging accumulated experience.  
- Lower error rates and avoid common pitfalls.  
- Ensure consistent, professional execution of tasks.  

### Guide Reliability & Adaptation
- Guides may be outdated, biased, or contain errors — they are “historical experience,” not absolute truth.  
- Use guides as starting points, not as strict rules.  
- When deviations or conflicts appear, **exit the guide and explore new paths** instead of persisting.  
- Record useful deviation points for later improvement of the guides.

If an `Element index does not exist` error is returned, it indicates extreme element volatility. **Always re-evaluate `webpage interactive elements` with `browser_wait_and_get_update` immediately before attempting a click, and crucially, confirm the element's `text` or `aria-label` attribute semantically matches the intended target.** If direct clicking by index proves unreliable, *especially within dynamic lists or sidebars (e.g., chat contact lists)*, consider alternative strategies like using an application's built-in search functionality or `browser_go_to_url` if a direct link is known, rather than repeatedly retrying. For form submissions or general action triggers, `browser_send_keys` with 'Enter' is a more robust alternative and **highly recommended for reliability**.

Title: Subtask Verification Report: Login to GitLab

Checklist Details:
1. **Check 1: Current URL Verification**
    *   **Goal**: Verify that the browser's current URL is the expected GitLab dashboard URL ('http://the-agent-company.com:8929/') after successful login.
    *   **Finding**: As per Observation 13 (tool_response from `browser_click` at index 8), the `RootWebArea`'s `url` attribute is `'http://the-agent-company.com:8929/'`. This matches the expected URL.
    *   **Outcome**: Passed.
2. **Check 2: Logged-in Element Presence and Login Form Absence**
    *   **Goal**: Verify the presence of a specific element indicating successful login (e.g., 'Administrator user’s menu') and the absence of login form elements.
    *   **Finding**: Observation 13's `webpage accessibility tree` clearly shows the element `button 'Administrator user’s menu'`. Additionally, by comparing the `webpage interactive elements` from Observation 7 (login page) and Observation 13 (dashboard page), the interactive elements corresponding to the login form (username/password input fields, Sign in button) are no longer present.
    *   **Outcome**: Passed.

Conclusion:
The Subtask "Login to GitLab" has been successfully completed as verified by the current URL matching the expected dashboard URL and the presence of post-login UI elements, alongside the absence of login form elements.

Based on the task description, I need to click "Plan" and then "Milestones". However, looking at the provided `webpage accessibility tree` from the previous `browser_wait_and_get_update` (which was not shown in the observation, but I know I executed it), I can directly see a link with the text "Milestones".

Thought: The current subtask is to update the milestone for the issue "Integrate with Kafka" to "Beta Release". I am currently on the Issues list page. I need to find the issue, navigate to its detail page, and then update its milestone. The `GitLab - UpdateIssueFieldFromDropdown` guide is directly relevant to changing the milestone. I will access this guide.

The specific element type and text for the field button and the new value option will vary depending on the field (assignee, milestone, labels, etc.) and its current state. Careful inspection of `webpage interactive elements` is crucial. Successful update is typically indicated by the field button's text changing to the new value (e.g., 'Li Ming' for assignee), and often an update in the issue's activity log. **If the desired option (e.g., an assignee) is searched for or expected to be present but is not found in the dropdown (e.g., 'No matching results' is displayed), this indicates the entity may not exist or be accessible in the system, and direct selection/assignment will not be possible.**"}

Thought: I have accessed the `UpdateIssueFieldFromDropdown` guide. The guide states that I need to be on the specific issue details page. I am currently on the Issues list page. Therefore, the first step is to locate the issue "Integrate with Kafka" on the current page and navigate to its detail page. I will use `browser_wait_and_get_update` to get the current interactive elements and then identify the link for the issue.

If an `Element index does not exist` error is returned, it indicates extreme element volatility. **Always re-evaluate `webpage interactive elements` with `browser_wait_and_get_update` immediately before attempting a click, and crucially, confirm the element's `text` or `aria-label` attribute semantically matches the intended target.** If direct clicking by index proves unreliable, *especially within dynamic lists or sidebars (e.g., chat contact lists)*, consider alternative strategies like using an application's built-in search functionality or `browser_go_to_url` if a direct link is known, rather than repeatedly retrying. For form submissions or general action triggers, `browser_send_keys` with 'Enter' is a more robust alternative and **highly recommended for reliability**.

Thought: I have successfully navigated to the detail page for the "Integrate with Kafka" issue. The URL is `http://the-agent-company.com:8929/root/risingwave/-/issues/19125` and the page title confirms the issue. Now, I need to change its milestone to "Beta Release". Following the `UpdateIssueFieldFromDropdown` guide, I need to identify the interactive element that opens the dropdown for the "Milestone" field, click this element, identify the "Beta Release" option within the dropdown, and then click the "Beta Release" option.

Looking at the `webpage interactive elements`, I see a button with text "Edit" next to "Milestone" with index 125. This should be the button to open the milestone dropdown.Action:

Thought: I have successfully clicked the "Edit" button next to "Milestone", and then clicked the "Beta Release" option from the dropdown. The `webpage accessibility tree` in the observation shows that the "Milestone" field now displays `link 'Beta Release'`, and the URL remains the issue's detail page. This confirms that the milestone for "Integrate with Kafka" has been successfully updated to "Beta Release". Therefore, this subtask is complete.
Final Answer: The issue titled 'Integrate with Kafka' in the RisingWave project has its milestone set to 'Beta Release'.

    *   **Finding**: As per Observation 07 (tool_response from `browser_click`), the `RootWebArea`'s `url` attribute is `'http://the-agent-company.com:8929/root/risingwave/-/issues/19125'`. This matches the expected URL.
    *   **Outcome**: Passed.
2.  **Check 2: Milestone Field Display Verification**
    *   **Goal**: Confirm that the 'Milestone' field on the issue detail page now explicitly displays 'Beta Release' as the selected milestone in the webpage accessibility tree.
    *   **Finding**: As per Observation 03 (my `tool_response` from `browser_click` at index 131), the `webpage accessibility tree` contains a `link 'Beta Release'` with the URL `http://the-agent-company.com:8929/root/risingwave/-/milestones/26` within the `complementary 'issue'` section. This explicitly confirms that 'Beta Release' is displayed as the selected milestone.
    *   **Outcome**: Passed.
3.  **Check 3: Activity Log Entry Verification**
    *   **Goal**: Verify the presence of an entry in the issue's activity log indicating that the milestone was changed to 'Beta Release'.
