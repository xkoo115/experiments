</tools>

2. **Python Code Execution**
When executing Python code, please output:
<code>
... your code ...
</code>
- The working directory is `/workspace`
- Executing dangerous, destructive, or time-consuming code is prohibited.
- If both a **Tool Call** and **Python Code Execution** are included in the output, the tool call takes precedence, and the Python code will not be executed.
- Using outdated or limited python libraries may result in incomplete or inaccurate observations (e.g. missing images from PDFs or failing to extract key content). Always prefer robust, modern libraries to ensure full and reliable results.
- When performing file conversion or data extraction, always ensure **data integrity**. Verify that the structure, content, and critical fields of the source file are preserved in the output. Check row and column counts, headers, and key values before and after processing. **Avoid silent loss**, truncation, or unintended alteration of data.

## Action Execution Result Processing
- After each action is executed, an Observation is returned, which includes:
    1. `<tool_response>`: The result of the tool or code execution.
    2. `<tool_instruction>`: The instruction associated with a specific action, used to guide the next step or restrict subsequent behavior.
- **Note**: Do not fabricate observations.

## Security and Restrictions
- **Coding Actions (such as Python, CMD, etc.)**
    - Do not run high-risk operations that are large in code size or take a long time.
    - Do not execute code that could cause data loss, system damage, or irreversible changes.
    - Do not use the kill command with wildcards like * or other dangerous parameters that could result in a wide range of matches.
    - Prefer using the Python interpreter to execute code (safer and more efficient) rather than using the CMD tool.

> ⚠️ **Important**
> When your output contains content that fully conforms to the **Tool Call** or **Python Code Execution** format, the system will immediately parse, identify, and execute it as an **Action** without further confirmation and without reversal.
> Therefore, before outputting, always confirm that this is your **intended** action and fully assess the potential consequences and risks.
> If you are only using **quotes, demonstrations, or examples**, be sure to break the formatting or escape it to prevent the system from interpreting it as a real action.

# OBJECTIVE #
Your core objective is to independently and efficiently complete the tasks assigned to you by the company.


# MEMORY #
During previous tasks, you have accumulated the following reusable knowledge:

## Resolution Patterns
Comprehensive Contextualization: Systematically acquire and aggregate information from diverse, potentially unstructured sources, prioritizing local processing and cross-validation, to ensure a complete, coherent operational view and inform robust decisions.
Robust External Interaction: Prioritize stable, predictable interaction methods, such as structured APIs, and dynamically adapt strategies to ensure continuity and reliability with external systems despite their inconsistencies or volatility.
Adaptive Constraint Handling: When an objective is blocked by an unresolvable external constraint, acknowledge the limitation, perform necessary cleanup of partial artifacts, and adapt the strategy to proceed with viable data, avoiding unproductive retries.
Modular Resilient Design: Decompose operations into modular, decoupled units with explicit state management, to enhance predictability, isolate errors, improve maintainability, and ensure operational continuity.
Progressive Verification: Implement multi-stage validation, from granular checks within pipelines to comprehensive outcome validation, to localize errors, confirm system states, and ensure successful execution.

## Platform/Application Operation Guides
These guides summarize proven operation paths derived from past successful experiences.  
Each item is a structured reference designed to help you complete operations more quickly, accurately, and with reduced redundancy.

> This directory provides a comprehensive index of guides, compiling best practices and experience summaries for accomplishing various tasks.

### Recommended Usage Process
1. **Review the Guide First**  
   Before starting a task, browse the relevant entries in the directory to identify potentially useful guidance.  
2. **Targeted Access**  
   Use the `access_the_application_guide` tool to view detailed steps if necessary.  
3. **Reuse with Flexibility**  
   Apply past successful steps when they fit the current situation, but stay aware of possible mismatches.  
4. **Explore When Deviations Arise**  
   If the environment or results diverge from the guide, stop rigidly following it and explore alternative approaches through small, safe, and adaptive steps.

### Value of Guides
- Reduce task completion time by leveraging accumulated experience.  
- Lower error rates and avoid common pitfalls.  
- Ensure consistent, professional execution of tasks.  

### Guide Reliability & Adaptation
- Guides may be outdated, biased, or contain errors — they are “historical experience,” not absolute truth.  
- Use guides as starting points, not as strict rules.  
- When deviations or conflicts appear, **exit the guide and explore new paths** instead of persisting.  
- Record useful deviation points for later improvement of the guides.

SubTask1: Clone Sotopia Repository
Goal: The 'sotopia' project repository is successfully cloned to the local workspace.
05. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================
Thought: For SubTask 1, I need to clone a GitLab repository. The relevant guide is `GitLab - CloneRepository`. I will access this guide to get the necessary instructions.

Replace `<project_name>` with the actual project name (e.g., 'sotopia'), `<extracted_repository_url>` with the URL obtained from the UI, and `<target_directory_path>` with the local path where the repository should be cloned (e.g., '/workspace/sotopia'). Verify cloning success by checking `run_cmd`'s `returncode` (0), confirming target directory existence (`System: ExecuteShellCommand(command='ls <target_directory_path>')`), and the presence of the `.git` subdirectory (`System: ExecuteShellCommand(command='ls -a <target_directory_path>')`). Also, verify the remote origin (`System: ExecuteShellCommand(command='git -C <target_directory_path> remote -v')."}
</CloneRepository>
</Application>
</tool_response>
<tool_instruction>
After accessing, carefully read the guide content. Extract and adapt relevant steps, recognizing that guide information may be outdated or require UI verification. Always prioritize current browser state by performing `browser_wait_and_get_update()` immediately before attempting to follow guide steps.
</tool_instruction>

07. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================
Thought: The guide provides a clear set of steps for cloning a repository. I need to navigate to the project URL, find the clone URL, and then use `git clone`.

First, I will navigate to the GitLab project URL for `sotopia`.
<tool_call>
{"name": "browser_go_to_url", "arguments": {"url": "http://the-agent-company.com:8929/root/sotopia"}}
</tool_call>
08. | ================================================== USER MESSAGE ==================================================
Observation: 
<tool_response>
Performed browser action: 🔗 Navigated to http://the-agent-company.com:8929/root/sotopia
The updated browser page status is as follows:
<webpage accessibility tree>[SYSTEM INFO: History accessibility tree removed for brevity]</webpage accessibility tree>
<webpage interactive elements>[SYSTEM INFO: History interactive elements removed for brevity]</webpage interactive elements>

</tool_response>
<tool_instruction>
Always inspect the `webpage accessibility tree` and `webpage interactive elements` after navigation to confirm the page loaded as expected. This step is crucial for verifying successful navigation and for preparing for subsequent interactions by ensuring the browser state is as anticipated.
</tool_instruction>

09. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================
Thought: I have successfully navigated to the sotopia project page. Now I need to find the "Code" button to get the clone URL. From the `webpage interactive elements`, I can see a button with the text "Code" and index `37`. I will click this button.
<tool_call>
{"name": "browser_click", "arguments": {"index": 37}}
</tool_call>
10. | ================================================== USER MESSAGE ==================================================
Observation: 
<tool_response>

The updated browser page status is as follows:
<webpage accessibility tree>[SYSTEM INFO: History accessibility tree removed for brevity]</webpage accessibility tree>
<webpage interactive elements>[SYSTEM INFO: History interactive elements removed for brevity]</webpage interactive elements>

</tool_response>
<tool_instruction>
If an `Element index does not exist` error is returned, it indicates extreme element volatility. **Always re-evaluate `webpage interactive elements` with `browser_wait_and_get_update` immediately before attempting a click, and crucially, confirm the element's `text` or `aria-label` attribute semantically matches the intended target.** If direct clicking by index proves unreliable, *especially within dynamic lists or sidebars (e.g., chat contact lists)*, consider alternative strategies like using an application's built-in search functionality or `browser_go_to_url` if a direct link is known, rather than repeatedly retrying. For form submissions or general action triggers, `browser_send_keys` with 'Enter' is a more robust alternative and **highly recommended for reliability**.
</tool_instruction>

11. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================
Thought: I have successfully clicked the "Code" button, and now the clone options are visible. I need to extract the HTTP clone URL. I can see a `textbox` containing 'http://the-agent-company.com:8929/root/sotopia.git' associated with "Clone with HTTP". I will use `browser_extract_content_by_vision` to extract this URL.

Thought: The previous attempt to extract the URL using `browser_extract_content_by_vision` did not yield the expected result. The observation shows a general browser action rather than the extracted text. I need to be more precise in my query to `browser_extract_content_by_vision` to target the specific textbox containing the HTTP clone URL. I will ask to extract the text from the textbox labeled "Clone with HTTP".

Thought: The previous attempt to extract the clone URL using `browser_extract_content_by_vision` was not successful, as it returned the current page's URL instead of the textbox content. I need to be more precise in my query. I will try to extract the content of the textbox that specifically contains the HTTP clone URL.

17. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================
Thought: My previous attempts to extract the clone URL using `browser_extract_content_by_vision` were unsuccessful. The observation showed that the tool tried to navigate to the URL instead of extracting the content. This indicates that `browser_extract_content_by_vision` might not be the best tool for extracting specific text from a non-interactive element like a read-only textbox, or my query was not precise enough.

However, looking at the `webpage accessibility tree` from the previous observation, I can see the clone URL: `http://the-agent-company.com:8929/root/sotopia.git` embedded within a `StaticText` element inside a `textbox` element. I can use Python to parse the `webpage accessibility tree` and extract this URL.

First, I will store the `webpage accessibility tree` content in a variable and then use Python to extract the URL.

Always check `command_result.returncode`: `0` indicates success; non-zero suggests an error; analyze `command_result.stderr`. For successful commands, process `command_result.stdout`. *Note: `command_result.stderr` may contain non-error information; evaluate contextually.* **Crucially, for any sequence of shell commands or when integrating shell output with Python logic, *always encapsulate the entire interaction within a single Python script using `subprocess`* for maximum robustness and control, rather than relying on discrete `run_cmd` calls or shell features like redirection.**

Thought: I have successfully read the content of `sotopia/agents/llm_agent.py`. I have analyzed the code and understand its structure, particularly the `LLMAgent` class, its `__init__` method, `goal` property, and `aact` method. I have identified that the `ActionAgent` should inherit from `BaseAgent` and its `aact` method should focus on selecting from `obs.available_actions` without generating goals. This understanding is sufficient to proceed with implementing the `ActionAgent`. Therefore, this subtask is complete.
Final Answer: The content of 'sotopia/agents/llm_agent.py' has been successfully read and understood, providing the necessary inspiration for implementing the new 'ActionAgent'.

Title: Subtask 3: Read LLMAgent for Inspiration Verification Report

Checklist Details:
- **Check 1: `verify_file_read_success`**
    - **Result**: PASSED. The `run_cmd` action successfully executed the `cat` command to read the file. This is confirmed by `execution_status: "COMMAND_EXECUTED"` and `returncode: 0` in Observation 05, indicating a successful command execution.
- **Check 2: `verify_content_presence`**
    - **Result**: PASSED. The `stdout` in Observation 05 contains the complete Python code of `sotopia/agents/llm_agent.py`, starting with imports and including class definitions like `LLMAgent`, `ScriptWritingAgent`, and `HumanAgent`. This confirms that the file's content was fully retrieved and presented to the Task Agent.

Here's the content for `action_agent.py`:

```python
import asyncio
from typing import cast

from sotopia.agents import BaseAgent
from sotopia.database import AgentProfile
from sotopia.messages import AgentAction, Observation

class ActionAgent(BaseAgent[Observation, AgentAction]):
    def __init__(

    def act(
        self,
        _obs: Observation,
    ) -> AgentAction:
        raise Exception("Sync act method is deprecated. Use aact instead.")

    async def aact(self, obs: Observation) -> AgentAction:
        self.recv_message("Environment", obs)

        if len(obs.available_actions) == 1 and "none" in obs.available_actions:
            return AgentAction(action_type="none", argument="")
        else:
            # ActionAgent will pick the first available action and provide an empty argument.
            chosen_action_type = obs.available_actions[0]
            argument = ""
            return AgentAction(action_type=chosen_action_type, argument=argument)

Title: Subtask 5: Implement ActionAgent Class Verification Report

Checklist Details:
- **Check 1: `verify_file_existence`**
    - **Result**: PASSED. The `ls -l` command successfully confirmed the existence of the file `/workspace/sotopia/sotopia/agents/action_agent.py` with `returncode: 0` and the output showing the file details. (Refer to Observation 1 of this verification process)
- **Check 2: `verify_file_content`**
    - **Result**: PASSED. The `cat` command successfully executed and returned the content of `/workspace/sotopia/sotopia/agents/action_agent.py`. The `stdout` of the `cat` command exactly matches the `file_content` that the Task Agent intended to write to the file. (Refer to Observation 3 of this verification process and the Task Agent's trajectory at step 02)
- **Check 3: `verify_action_agent_class_signature`**
    - **Result**: PASSED. The inspected file content clearly contains the class definition `class ActionAgent(BaseAgent[Observation, AgentAction]):`, confirming proper inheritance and generic type arguments.
- **Check 4: `verify_aact_method_present_and_structure`**
    - **Result**: PASSED. The `async def aact(self, obs: Observation) -> AgentAction:` method is present within the `ActionAgent` class. Its structure correctly handles `obs.available_actions` and returns an `AgentAction` object as intended.

Conclusion:
All verification checks passed. The 'ActionAgent' class has been fully and correctly implemented in 'sotopia/agents/action_agent.py', including its inheritance, constructor, 'goal' property, and the 'aact' method as specified. The Subtask is complete.

Title: Subtask 6: Add ActionAgent to Agents Init Verification Report

Checklist Details:
- **Check 1: `verify_init_file_content`**
    - **Result**: PASSED. The `run_cmd` command `cat /workspace/sotopia/sotopia/agents/__init__.py` successfully executed with `returncode: 0`. The `stdout` clearly shows the line `from .action_agent import ActionAgent # Added this line` and `ActionAgent` within the `__all__` list. This confirms that the `ActionAgent` import and exposure are correctly present in the `__init__.py` file. (Refer to Observation 1 of this verification process).

Conclusion:
All verification checks passed. The `ActionAgent` has been correctly imported and added to the `__all__` list in `sotopia/agents/__init__.py`. The Subtask is complete.

Title: Subtask 8: Push Changes Verification Report

Checklist Details:
- **Check 1: `verify_push_command_success`**
    - **Result**: PASSED. The `git push` command executed by the Task Agent in Observation 05 returned `returncode: 0`, indicating successful execution. The `stderr` also confirms the successful push of the `feature/actionAgent` branch to the remote repository with the message "* [new branch] feature/actionAgent -> feature/actionAgent".
- **Check 2: `verify_remote_branch_existence`**
    - **Result**: PASSED. The `git ls-remote` command proactively confirmed the existence of the 'feature/actionAgent' branch on the remote GitLab repository. The command executed with `returncode: 0`, and its `stdout` showed `0298378aa9a1b048f7dedabc5be226a192af72c4\trefs/heads/feature/actionAgent`, explicitly listing the remote branch.

Conclusion:
All verification checks passed. The 'feature/actionAgent' branch, along with all its committed changes, has been successfully pushed to the remote GitLab repository, and its existence on the remote was confirmed. The Subtask is complete.

If an `Element index does not exist` error is returned, it indicates extreme element volatility. **Always re-evaluate `webpage interactive elements` with `browser_wait_and_get_update` immediately before attempting a click, and crucially, confirm the element's `text` or `aria-label` attribute semantically matches the intended target.** If direct clicking by index proves unreliable, *especially within dynamic lists or sidebars (e.g., chat contact lists)*, consider alternative strategies like using an application's built-in search functionality or `browser_go_to_url` if a direct link is known, rather than repeatedly retrying. For form submissions or general action triggers, `browser_send_keys` with 'Enter' is a more robust alternative and **highly recommended for reliability**.

Title: Subtask 9: Create Merge Request Verification Report

Checklist Details:
- **Check 1: `verify_merge_request_page_loaded`**
    - **Result**: PASSED. The browser successfully navigated to the merge request details page, as indicated by the URL `http://the-agent-company.com:8929/root/sotopia/-/merge_requests/217` and the `RootWebArea` title `feat: Add ActionAgent and expose it in __init__.py (!217) · Merge requests · Administrator / sotopia · GitLab` in Observation 19 of the Task Agent's trajectory.
- **Check 2: `verify_mr_id_in_url`**
    - **Result**: PASSED. The URL in Observation 19 of the Task Agent's trajectory is `http://the-agent-company.com:8929/root/sotopia/-/merge_requests/217`. The number `217` clearly indicates a unique merge request ID, confirming the creation of a distinct merge request.
- **Check 3: `verify_mr_title`**
    - **Result**: PASSED. The displayed title of the created merge request, as seen in Observation 19's `<webpage accessibility tree>`, is `heading 'feat: Add ActionAgent and expose it in __init__.py', level=1`. This exactly matches the expected title.
- **Check 4: `verify_source_and_target_branches`**
    - **Result**: PASSED. The merge request details page in Observation 19 explicitly states that it is merging 'feature/actionAgent' into 'main', as shown by the text "feature/actionAgent into main" within the `<webpage accessibility tree>`.

Conclusion:
All verification checks passed. A merge request has been successfully created in GitLab, proposing to merge the 'feature/actionAgent' branch into the 'main' development branch, and the browser is displaying the details of this newly created merge request. The Subtask is complete.
