Returns a JSON object with `execution_status`, `returncode`, `stdout`, and `stderr`. **Important Precautions**: 1) `returncode=0` does not guarantee successful side effects (e.g., file creation); always verify with independent checks (`ls -l`, `file`). 2) **This tool executes commands in a *minimal* shell environment. Complex shell features like command chaining (`&&`, `||`), pipes (`|`), I/O redirection (`>`, `>>`), and backgrounding (`&`) are often *not reliably interpreted by `run_cmd` directly* and can lead to unexpected behavior or errors (e.g., `SyntaxError`, `command not found`). For any non-trivial shell interaction or complex logic, *always prefer consolidating operations into a single Python script that uses `subprocess` for explicit control and robustness* over multiple `run_cmd` calls or complex shell syntax.** 3) Quote arguments containing spaces (`\"path with spaces\"`). 4) State changes (`cd`) do not persist across calls.", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"command": {"type": "string", "description": "command暂时没有参数描述"}}, "required": ["command"]}}}
</tools>

2. **Python Code Execution**
When executing Python code, please output:
<code>
... your code ...
</code>
- The working directory is `/workspace`
- Executing dangerous, destructive, or time-consuming code is prohibited.
- If both a **Tool Call** and **Python Code Execution** are included in the output, the tool call takes precedence, and the Python code will not be executed.
- Using outdated or limited python libraries may result in incomplete or inaccurate observations (e.g. missing images from PDFs or failing to extract key content). Always prefer robust, modern libraries to ensure full and reliable results.
- When performing file conversion or data extraction, always ensure **data integrity**. Verify that the structure, content, and critical fields of the source file are preserved in the output. Check row and column counts, headers, and key values before and after processing. **Avoid silent loss**, truncation, or unintended alteration of data.

## Action Execution Result Processing
- After each action is executed, an Observation is returned, which includes:
    1. `<tool_response>`: The result of the tool or code execution.
    2. `<tool_instruction>`: The instruction associated with a specific action, used to guide the next step or restrict subsequent behavior.
- **Note**: Do not fabricate observations.

## Security and Restrictions
- **Coding Actions (such as Python, CMD, etc.)**
    - Do not run high-risk operations that are large in code size or take a long time.
    - Do not execute code that could cause data loss, system damage, or irreversible changes.
    - Do not use the kill command with wildcards like * or other dangerous parameters that could result in a wide range of matches.
    - Prefer using the Python interpreter to execute code (safer and more efficient) rather than using the CMD tool.

> ⚠️ **Important**
> When your output contains content that fully conforms to the **Tool Call** or **Python Code Execution** format, the system will immediately parse, identify, and execute it as an **Action** without further confirmation and without reversal.
> Therefore, before outputting, always confirm that this is your **intended** action and fully assess the potential consequences and risks.
> If you are only using **quotes, demonstrations, or examples**, be sure to break the formatting or escape it to prevent the system from interpreting it as a real action.

# OBJECTIVE #
Your core objective is to independently and efficiently complete the tasks assigned to you by the company.


# MEMORY #
During previous tasks, you have accumulated the following reusable knowledge:

## Resolution Patterns
Comprehensive Contextualization: Systematically acquire and aggregate information from diverse, potentially unstructured sources, prioritizing local processing and cross-validation, to ensure a complete, coherent operational view and inform robust decisions.
Robust External Interaction: Prioritize stable, predictable interaction methods, such as structured APIs, and dynamically adapt strategies to ensure continuity and reliability with external systems despite their inconsistencies or volatility.
Adaptive Constraint Handling: When an objective is blocked by an unresolvable external constraint, acknowledge the limitation, perform necessary cleanup of partial artifacts, and adapt the strategy to proceed with viable data, avoiding unproductive retries.
Modular Resilient Design: Decompose operations into modular, decoupled units with explicit state management, to enhance predictability, isolate errors, improve maintainability, and ensure operational continuity.
Progressive Verification: Implement multi-stage validation, from granular checks within pipelines to comprehensive outcome validation, to localize errors, confirm system states, and ensure successful execution.

## Platform/Application Operation Guides
These guides summarize proven operation paths derived from past successful experiences.  
Each item is a structured reference designed to help you complete operations more quickly, accurately, and with reduced redundancy.

> This directory provides a comprehensive index of guides, compiling best practices and experience summaries for accomplishing various tasks.

### Recommended Usage Process
1. **Review the Guide First**  
   Before starting a task, browse the relevant entries in the directory to identify potentially useful guidance.  
2. **Targeted Access**  
   Use the `access_the_application_guide` tool to view detailed steps if necessary.  
3. **Reuse with Flexibility**  
   Apply past successful steps when they fit the current situation, but stay aware of possible mismatches.  
4. **Explore When Deviations Arise**  
   If the environment or results diverge from the guide, stop rigidly following it and explore alternative approaches through small, safe, and adaptive steps.

### Value of Guides
- Reduce task completion time by leveraging accumulated experience.  
- Lower error rates and avoid common pitfalls.  
- Ensure consistent, professional execution of tasks.  

### Guide Reliability & Adaptation
- Guides may be outdated, biased, or contain errors — they are “historical experience,” not absolute truth.  
- Use guides as starting points, not as strict rules.  
- When deviations or conflicts appear, **exit the guide and explore new paths** instead of persisting.  
- Record useful deviation points for later improvement of the guides.

Thought: The content of `hash_util.h` has been successfully read. Now I need to perform the string replacement.

The original line is: `hash = ((hash << 5) ^ (hash >> 27)) ^ bytes[i];`
The target line is: `hash = ((hash << 5) ^ (hash >> 27)) ^ static_cast<signed char>(bytes[i]);`

I will use Python's `replace()` method to substitute the old line with the new one and then write the modified content back to the file.

Title: Subtask 3: Apply hash utility compatibility fix Verification Report

Checklist Details:
1.  **read_file_content**:
    *   **Goal**: Read the content of `/workspace/bustub/src/include/common/util/hash_util.h` to obtain the current state of the file.
    *   **Result**: **PASS**. The content of the file was successfully read and outputted, as seen in the `stdout` of Observation 9 in the Task Agent's trajectory, and also confirmed by the `tool_response` from the `read_file_content` check step.
2.  **verify_old_line_absence**:
    *   **Goal**: Verify that the line '      hash = ((hash << 5) ^ (hash >> 27)) ^ bytes[i];' (including leading spaces) is NOT present in the content of `/workspace/bustub/src/include/common/util/hash_util.h`.
    *   **Result**: **PASS**. Review of the file content (from Observation 9 and `read_file_content` check step) confirms that the old line is indeed absent. The line starting with `hash = ((hash << 5) ^ (hash >> 27)) ^ ` now contains `static_cast<signed char>(bytes[i]);` instead of `bytes[i];`.
3.  **verify_new_line_presence**:
    *   **Goal**: Verify that the line '      hash = ((hash << 5) ^ (hash >> 27)) ^ static_cast<signed char>(bytes[i]);' (including leading spaces) IS present in the content of `/workspace/bustub/src/include/common/util/hash_util.h`.
    *   **Result**: **PASS**. Review of the file content (from Observation 9 and `read_file_content` check step) clearly shows the presence of the exact new line: `      hash = ((hash << 5) ^ (hash >> 27)) ^ static_cast<signed char>(bytes[i]);`.

Conclusion:
The Subtask "Apply hash utility compatibility fix" is **complete**. All verification steps have passed, confirming that the specified line in `bustub/src/include/common/util/hash_util.h` has been correctly updated to `hash = ((hash << 5) ^ (hash >> 27)) ^ static_cast<signed char>(bytes[i]);`.

Here's the C++ code for `hyperloglog.h`:

```cpp
#pragma once

#include <algorithm>
#include <cmath>
#include <vector>

#include "common/macros.h"

  ~HyperLogLog() = default;

  /**
   * Adds an element to the HyperLogLog.

  void Add(const uint8_t *data, size_t len);

  /**
   * Returns the number of unique elements added to the HyperLogLog.
   * @return The number of unique elements.
   */
  size_t Count() const;

  /**
   * Merges another HyperLogLog into this one.
   * @param other The other HyperLogLog to merge.
   */
  void Merge(const HyperLogLog &other);

  /**
   * Estimates the cardinality of the set.
   * @return The estimated cardinality.
   */
  double Estimate() const;

  /**
   * Clears the HyperLogLog, resetting all registers to 0.
   */
  void Clear();

  /**
   * Returns the size of the registers vector (number of registers).
   * @return The number of registers.
   */
  size_t GetSize() const;

  /**
   * Sets the value of a specific register.
   * @param idx The index of the register to set.
   * @param val The value to set.
   */
  void Set(size_t idx, uint8_t val);

  /**
   * Gets the value of a specific register.
   * @param idx The index of the register to get.
   * @return The value of the register.
   */
  uint8_t Get(size_t idx) const;

 private:
  // The number of bits used for the hash function to determine the register index.
  size_t num_bits_;
  // The number of registers, which is 2^num_bits_.
  size_t num_registers_;
  // The registers storing the maximum leading zero count for each bucket.

    *   **Result**: **PASS**. The `run_cmd` with `command="ls /workspace/bustub/src/include/primer/hyperloglog.h"` returned `returncode: 0` and `stdout: "/workspace/bustub/src/include/primer/hyperloglog.h"`, confirming the file's existence.
2.  **verify_file_content**:
    *   **Goal**: Read the content of `/workspace/bustub/src/include/primer/hyperloglog.h` and confirm that it exactly matches the C++ code for the HyperLogLog class and method declarations as provided by the Task Agent in the trajectory.
    *   **Result**: **PASS**. The content obtained using `cat /workspace/bustub/src/include/primer/hyperloglog.h` was compared byte-for-byte with the C++ code specified in the Task Agent's Action at step 04, and both are identical.

Conclusion:
The Subtask "Implement HyperLogLog Header File" is **complete**. Both verification steps have passed, confirming that the file `/workspace/bustub/src/include/primer/hyperloglog.h` has been successfully created and contains the correct C++ code for the HyperLogLog class and method declarations as specified in Issue 759.

Thought: I have the `WriteFile` guide. I need to create the content for `bustub/src/primer/hyperloglog.cpp`. This file will contain the implementation of the methods declared in `hyperloglog.h`.

Based on the issue description and common HyperLogLog implementations, I will define the following methods:
- `HyperLogLog::HyperLogLog(size_t num_bits)`: Constructor to initialize `num_bits_`, `num_registers_`, and `registers_`.
- `HyperLogLog::Add(const uint8_t *data, size_t len)`: Adds an element by hashing it, calculating the register index and the number of leading zeros, and updating the corresponding register.
- `HyperLogLog::Count() const`: Returns the current estimate of unique elements. This will likely call `Estimate()`.
- `HyperLogLog::Merge(const HyperLogLog &other)`: Merges another HLL by taking the maximum value for each corresponding register.
- `HyperLogLog::Estimate() const`: Calculates the cardinality estimate using the HyperLogLog formula.
- `HyperLogLog::Clear()`: Resets all registers to 0.
- `HyperLogLog::GetSize() const`: Returns `num_registers_`.
- `HyperLogLog::Set(size_t idx, uint8_t val)`: Sets a register value.
- `HyperLogLog::Get(size_t idx) const`: Gets a register value.

Here's the C++ code for `hyperloglog.cpp`:

```cpp
#include "primer/hyperloglog.h"

namespace bustub {

// Helper function to count leading zeros (rho)
// For a 64-bit hash, this counts leading zeros from the LSB up to 64 bits.
// This is a common way to implement rho for HLL.
size_t CountLeadingZeros(size_t hash_value, size_t max_bits) {
  if (hash_value == 0) {
    return max_bits;
  }
  size_t count = 0;
  // Count leading zeros from the most significant bit.
  // For HLL, we usually count the number of leading zeros *after* the register index bits.
  // So, if we use 'num_bits' for register index, the remaining bits are for rho.
  // This implementation is a generic count leading zeros, which might need adjustment
  // based on how the hash is split into register index and value for rho.
  // A more precise way for HLL:
  // hash_value >>= num_bits_ (to get the remaining bits for rho)
  // then count leading zeros on that.
  // For now, let's assume hash_value is already the part for rho.
  // A common approach for HLL is to use `__builtin_clzll` for 64-bit integers.
  // For simplicity here, let's assume we are counting leading zeros from the LSB
  // until we hit a 1, and the count is 1-indexed.
  // The actual HLL rho calculation is usually: find the position of the first 1-bit
  // starting from the most significant bit of the *remaining* hash after the bucket bits.

  // Let's re-evaluate based on typical HLL rho calculation:
  // rho(x) = position of the least significant 1-bit in x, starting from 1.
  // Example: 00010100 -> rho = 3 (1-indexed)
  // This is equivalent to `std::countr_zero` in C++20 or `__builtin_ctzll` in GCC/Clang.
  // Since we are not guaranteed C++20 or specific builtins, let's implement it.
  size_t rho = 1;
  while ((hash_value & 1) == 0 && rho <= max_bits) {
    rho++;
    hash_value >>= 1;
  }
  return rho;
}

HyperLogLog::HyperLogLog(size_t num_bits)
    : num_bits_(num_bits), num_registers_(1ULL << num_bits), registers_(num_registers_, 0) {
  // Ensure num_bits is within a reasonable range (e.g., 4 to 16 for typical HLL)
  // For simplicity, we'll trust the input for now.
}

  size_t register_idx = hash_value & ((1ULL << num_bits_) - 1);

  // Extract remaining bits for rho calculation

  // Calculate rho (position of the first 1-bit, 1-indexed)
  // If remaining_hash is 0, rho should be (64 - num_bits_) + 1, assuming 64-bit hash.
  // Or, more generally, the number of bits in the remaining hash + 1.
  size_t rho;

      rho++;
      remaining_hash >>= 1;
    }
    // Adjust rho to be relative to the full hash value, considering the num_bits_ shifted out.
    // The actual rho for HLL is 1 + position of the least significant 1-bit in the hash value
    // *after* the register bits, or 1 + number of trailing zeros.
    // Let's use __builtin_ctzll if available, otherwise a loop.
    // For now, let's assume the previous loop correctly calculates rho.

    // } else {

Thought: I have the `WriteFile` guide. I need to create the content for `bustub/src/include/primer/hyperloglog_presto.h`. This file will define the `HyperLogLogPresto` class, which is a variation of HyperLogLog. Based on the issue description, it should have a constructor, destructor, and similar methods to the standard HyperLogLog, but potentially with different internal logic or parameters to align with Presto's implementation.

113. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================
Thought: The `git push` command executed successfully, as indicated by `returncode: 0`. The `stderr` also shows a message indicating that a new branch `feature/issue-759-hyperloglog` was pushed and provides a URL to create a merge request. This confirms that all modified and new files have been committed to the new branch and successfully pushed to the remote 'bustub' repository on GitLab. Therefore, this subtask is complete.
Final Answer: All modified and new files (hyperloglog.h, hyperloglog_presto.h, hyperloglog.cpp, hyperloglog_presto.cpp, and hash_util.h) have been committed to the new branch 'feature/issue-759-hyperloglog' and successfully pushed to the remote 'bustub' repository on GitLab.

Title: Subtask 9: Commit and Push Changes Verification Report

Checklist Details:
1.  **verify_remote_branch_existence**:
    *   **Goal**: Confirm that the 'feature/issue-759-hyperloglog' branch exists on the remote GitLab repository by navigating to its tree view page and verifying the URL and page title.
    *   **Result**: **PASS**. The browser successfully navigated to `http://the-agent-company.com:8929/root/bustub/-/tree/feature/issue-759-hyperloglog`, and the `RootWebArea` title `'Files · feature/issue-759-hyperloglog · Administrator / bustub · GitLab'` confirmed the branch's existence. This is evident in the observation after step 1.
2.  **verify_latest_commit_message_on_branch**:
    *   **Goal**: Navigate to the commit history for the 'feature/issue-759-hyperloglog' branch and confirm that the latest commit message is 'feat: Implement HyperLogLog and HyperLogLogPresto for Issue #759 and apply compatibility fix', matching the Task Agent's commit action.
    *   **Result**: **PASS**. The browser navigated to `http://the-agent-company.com:8929/root/bustub/-/commits/feature/issue-759-hyperloglog`. The `webpage accessibility tree` in the observation after step 3 clearly shows the latest commit message as "feat: Implement HyperLogLog and HyperLogLogPresto for Issue #759 and apply compatibility fix", which precisely matches the message used by the Task Agent.
3.  **verify_presence_of_specific_file_on_remote_branch**:
    *   **Goal**: Navigate directly to the path of one of the newly added files ('bustub/src/include/primer/hyperloglog.h') on the remote 'feature/issue-759-hyperloglog' branch and verify its presence and that its content is consistent with the implementation, ensuring the files were indeed pushed.
    *   **Result**: **PASS**. The browser successfully navigated to `http://the-agent-company.com:8929/root/bustub/-/raw/feature/issue-759-hyperloglog/src/include/primer/hyperloglog.h`. The entire content of the `hyperloglog.h` file, as captured in the `webpage accessibility tree` of the observation after step 5, is present and matches the previously verified implementation, confirming its successful push to the remote branch.

Conclusion:
The Subtask "Commit and Push Changes" is **complete**. All verification steps have passed, confirming that the new branch `feature/issue-759-hyperloglog` was successfully created, the specified changes were committed with the correct message, and the new files (`hyperloglog.h`, `hyperloglog_presto.h`, `hyperloglog.cpp`, `hyperloglog_presto.cpp`, and the modified `hash_util.h`) are present on the remote GitLab repository.

SubTask10: Create Merge Request for Issue 759
Goal: A new merge request is created on GitLab, linking the committed changes from the new branch to Issue 759 and ready for review.
119. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================
Thought: The goal is to create a merge request for Issue 759. I have successfully pushed the changes to a new branch, and the `git push` command outputted a URL for creating a merge request. I will use this URL to navigate directly to the merge request creation page. The relevant guide would be `Browser: NavigateToURL`. I will also check for `GitLab: CreateMergeRequest` to see if there are specific instructions.
Platform/Application Operation Guide Directory entries that will be helpful:
- Browser: NavigateToURL
- GitLab: CreateMergeRequest
Action:
<tool_call>
{"name": "access_the_application_guide", "arguments": {"batch_requests": {"Browser": ["NavigateToURL"], "GitLab": ["CreateMergeRequest"]}}}

120. | ================================================== USER MESSAGE ==================================================
Observation: 
<tool_response>
<Application name="Browser">
<NavigateToURL>
{'preconditions': 'A browser session is active.', 'steps': 'browser_go_to_url(url="<target_url>") -> browser_wait_and_get_update(seconds=3)', 'notes': 'Navigates the browser to a specific URL.

A URL for creating a merge request from that branch is available (often provided by GitLab after `git push`).', 'steps': 'browser_go_to_url(url="<merge_request_creation_url>") -> browser_wait_and_get_update() -> Identify title input field (e.g., `textbox \'Title (required)\'`) -> browser_input_text(index=<title_field_index>, text="<mr_title>") -> browser_wait_and_get_update() -> browser_send_keys(keys="Enter")', 'notes': 'The `merge_request_creation_url` is typically provided by GitLab in the `stderr` output after a `git push` (e.g., `http://the-agent-company.com:8929/root/sotopia/-/merge_requests/new?merge_request%5Bsource_branch%5D=update-contribution-doc`). Element indices are dynamic; always verify current page elements via `browser_wait_and_get_update()` and `webpage interactive elements`. `browser_send_keys("Enter")` is often more robust for form submission than clicking a button. Successful MR creation is verified by the URL changing to the specific MR details page (e.g., `http://the-agent-company.com:8929/root/<project_path>/-/merge_requests/<MR_ID>`) and the page title.'}

</Application>
</tool_response>
<tool_instruction>
After accessing, carefully read the guide content. Extract and adapt relevant steps, recognizing that guide information may be outdated or require UI verification. Always prioritize current browser state by performing `browser_wait_and_get_update()` immediately before attempting to follow guide steps.

<tool_instruction>
Always inspect the `webpage accessibility tree` and `webpage interactive elements` after navigation to confirm the page loaded as expected. This step is crucial for verifying successful navigation and for preparing for subsequent interactions by ensuring the browser state is as anticipated.
</tool_instruction>

123. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================
Thought: The merge request creation page has loaded successfully. The title is pre-filled with the commit message. I need to click the "Create merge request" button to submit the merge request. The interactive elements show a button with text "Create merge request" at index 93.

<webpage interactive elements>[SYSTEM INFO: History interactive elements removed for brevity]</webpage interactive elements>

</tool_response>
<tool_instruction>
If an `Element index does not exist` error is returned, it indicates extreme element volatility. **Always re-evaluate `webpage interactive elements` with `browser_wait_and_get_update` immediately before attempting a click, and crucially, confirm the element's `text` or `aria-label` attribute semantically matches the intended target.** If direct clicking by index proves unreliable, *especially within dynamic lists or sidebars (e.g., chat contact lists)*, consider alternative strategies like using an application's built-in search functionality or `browser_go_to_url` if a direct link is known, rather than repeatedly retrying. For form submissions or general action triggers, `browser_send_keys` with 'Enter' is a more robust alternative and **highly recommended for reliability**.
</tool_instruction>

125. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================
Thought: The previous attempt to click the "Create merge request" button failed due to an outdated element index. The `tool_instruction` suggests that `browser_send_keys` with 'Enter' is a more robust alternative for form submissions. I will use this method to submit the merge request.
Action:
<tool_call>
{"name": "browser_send_keys", "arguments": {"keys": "Enter"}}

</tool_response>
<tool_instruction>
After sending keys, *especially when a response or UI change is expected (e.g., chat message sent, form submitted)*, immediately use `browser_wait_and_get_update` to refresh the page state and verify the intended effect (e.g., message displayed, UI updated, data persisted).
</tool_instruction>

127. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================
Thought: The `browser_send_keys("Enter")` action successfully submitted the merge request. The browser has navigated to the newly created merge request page, as indicated by the URL `http://the-agent-company.com:8929/root/bustub/-/merge_requests/758` and the page title `feat: Implement HyperLogLog and HyperLogLogPresto for Issue #759 and apply compatibility fix (!758) · Merge requests · Administrator / bustub · GitLab`. This confirms that the merge request has been created and is ready for review. Therefore, this subtask is complete.
Final Answer: A new merge request has been successfully created on GitLab, linking the committed changes from the new branch to Issue 759 and is ready for review.
