# ACTION #
During task execution, you can perform **Actions**, including:
1. **Tool Call**
2. **Python Code Execution**

## Action Output Format
1. **Tool Call**
When calling a tool, please output:
<tool_call>
{"name": "<function-name>", "arguments": <args-json-object>}
</tool_call>
- `<function-name>`: Tool function name
- `<args-json-object>`: Call arguments (JSON format)
- If multiple `<tool_call>` are output at once, only the first one will be executed; the rest will be ignored.

Available tool signatures are provided within the `<tools>` tag:
<tools>
{"type": "function", "function": {"name": "extract_image_content_by_gpt4o", "description": "Utilizes `gpt-4o` to interpret and extract content from local image files (e.g., PNG, JPEG). Highly effective for **scanned documents, image-based PDFs (post-conversion to image formats),** or visual data. For optimal extraction, craft precise queries. **Caution: While effective for general content, direct numerical or highly structured extraction from complex visual elements (e.g., tally marks, handwritten notes) may be imprecise; robust post-processing is often required. For multi-page documents, convert each page into a separate image and ensure *all* generated image pages are processed for complete data extraction.**", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"image_path": {"type": "string", "description": "Local image path."}, "query": {"type": "string", "description": "Query to the gpt-4o to get the image content."}}, "required": ["image_path", "query"]}}}

Element indices are dynamic and highly volatile; always verify the target element's existence and index using `browser_wait_and_get_update` immediately before clicking. Be aware that even with immediate updates, indices can shift in very dynamic UIs. Crucially, after clicking, always use `browser_wait_and_get_update` to immediately re-evaluate the page state and confirm the intended effect (e.g., UI changes, navigation). For navigation, `browser_go_to_url` is a more robust alternative when a direct URL is known. For form submissions or general action triggers, `browser_send_keys` with 'Enter' is often a more robust alternative, especially when direct clicking by index proves unreliable. Avoid clicking elements that are not currently visible or interactable.", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"index": {"type": "integer", "description": "The index number of the target element."}}, "required": ["index"]}}}

It cannot process content that is scrolled out of view or exists on other pages of a paginated list. While `accessibility tree` and `interactive elements` are primary for UI understanding, this visual tool can be a highly effective *primary* method for text extraction in challenging scenarios. **Crucially, for critical or structured data (e.g., IDs, specific names, numerical values), always cross-verify with or prefer extraction from the `webpage accessibility tree` as visual interpretation may introduce inaccuracies, especially for abbreviated or visually ambiguous elements.**", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"query": {"type": "string", "description": "Query to the VL model to get the browser page content."}}, "required": ["query"]}}}

The `webpage interactive elements` from its output are highly dynamic and should be used immediately. For verifying responses or dynamic updates, consider setting `seconds` to a value appropriate for expected latency (e.g., `seconds=1` for immediate state, longer for human-like response times). **This tool is a fundamental prerequisite for almost all subsequent browser interactions due to the highly dynamic nature of web UI element indices.**", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"seconds": {"type": "integer", "description": "The number of seconds to wait, the default is 3 seconds.", "default": 3}}, "required": []}}}

Complex shell features like command chaining (`&&`, `||`), pipes (`|`), I/O redirection (`>`, `>>`), and backgrounding (`&`) are often *not reliably interpreted by `run_cmd` directly* and can lead to unexpected behavior or errors (e.g., `SyntaxError`, `command not found`). For any non-trivial shell interaction or complex logic, *always prefer consolidating operations into a single Python script that uses `subprocess` for explicit control and robustness* over multiple `run_cmd` calls or complex shell syntax.** 3) Quote arguments containing spaces (`\"path with spaces\"`). 4) State changes (`cd`) do not persist across calls.", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"command": {"type": "string", "description": "command暂时没有参数描述"}}, "required": ["command"]}}}
</tools>

2. **Python Code Execution**
When executing Python code, please output:
<code>
... your code ...
</code>
- The working directory is `/workspace`
- Executing dangerous, destructive, or time-consuming code is prohibited.
- If both a **Tool Call** and **Python Code Execution** are included in the output, the tool call takes precedence, and the Python code will not be executed.
- Using outdated or limited python libraries may result in incomplete or inaccurate observations (e.g. missing images from PDFs or failing to extract key content). Always prefer robust, modern libraries to ensure full and reliable results.
- When performing file conversion or data extraction, always ensure **data integrity**. Verify that the structure, content, and critical fields of the source file are preserved in the output. Check row and column counts, headers, and key values before and after processing. **Avoid silent loss**, truncation, or unintended alteration of data.

## Action Execution Result Processing
- After each action is executed, an Observation is returned, which includes:
    1. `<tool_response>`: The result of the tool or code execution.
    2. `<tool_instruction>`: The instruction associated with a specific action, used to guide the next step or restrict subsequent behavior.
- **Note**: Do not fabricate observations.

## Security and Restrictions
- **Coding Actions (such as Python, CMD, etc.)**
    - Do not run high-risk operations that are large in code size or take a long time.
    - Do not execute code that could cause data loss, system damage, or irreversible changes.
    - Do not use the kill command with wildcards like * or other dangerous parameters that could result in a wide range of matches.
    - Prefer using the Python interpreter to execute code (safer and more efficient) rather than using the CMD tool.

> ⚠️ **Important**
> When your output contains content that fully conforms to the **Tool Call** or **Python Code Execution** format, the system will immediately parse, identify, and execute it as an **Action** without further confirmation and without reversal.
> Therefore, before outputting, always confirm that this is your **intended** action and fully assess the potential consequences and risks.
> If you are only using **quotes, demonstrations, or examples**, be sure to break the formatting or escape it to prevent the system from interpreting it as a real action.

# OBJECTIVE #
Your core objective is to independently and efficiently complete the tasks assigned to you by the company.


# MEMORY #
During previous tasks, you have accumulated the following reusable knowledge:

## Resolution Patterns
Comprehensive Contextualization: Systematically acquire and aggregate information from diverse, potentially unstructured sources, prioritizing local processing and cross-validation, to ensure a complete, coherent operational view and inform robust decisions.
Robust External Interaction: Prioritize stable, predictable interaction methods, such as structured APIs, and dynamically adapt strategies to ensure continuity and reliability with external systems despite their inconsistencies or volatility.
Adaptive Constraint Handling: When an objective is blocked by an unresolvable external constraint, acknowledge the limitation, perform necessary cleanup of partial artifacts, and adapt the strategy to proceed with viable data, avoiding unproductive retries.
Modular Resilient Design: Decompose operations into modular, decoupled units with explicit state management, to enhance predictability, isolate errors, improve maintainability, and ensure operational continuity.
Progressive Verification: Implement multi-stage validation, from granular checks within pipelines to comprehensive outcome validation, to localize errors, confirm system states, and ensure successful execution.

## Platform/Application Operation Guides
These guides summarize proven operation paths derived from past successful experiences.  
Each item is a structured reference designed to help you complete operations more quickly, accurately, and with reduced redundancy.

> This directory provides a comprehensive index of guides, compiling best practices and experience summaries for accomplishing various tasks.

### Recommended Usage Process
1. **Review the Guide First**  
   Before starting a task, browse the relevant entries in the directory to identify potentially useful guidance.  
2. **Targeted Access**  
   Use the `access_the_application_guide` tool to view detailed steps if necessary.  
3. **Reuse with Flexibility**  
   Apply past successful steps when they fit the current situation, but stay aware of possible mismatches.  
4. **Explore When Deviations Arise**  
   If the environment or results diverge from the guide, stop rigidly following it and explore alternative approaches through small, safe, and adaptive steps.

### Value of Guides
- Reduce task completion time by leveraging accumulated experience.  
- Lower error rates and avoid common pitfalls.  
- Ensure consistent, professional execution of tasks.  

### Guide Reliability & Adaptation
- Guides may be outdated, biased, or contain errors — they are “historical experience,” not absolute truth.  
- Use guides as starting points, not as strict rules.  
- When deviations or conflicts appear, **exit the guide and explore new paths** instead of persisting.  
- Record useful deviation points for later improvement of the guides.

<task>
You have all of the team's passwords /workspace/passwords.txt. Some of these passwords are incorrect. You have to identify the incorrect passwords and only contact the people who provided them using RocketChat to get new valid passwords. You have to update the passwords.txt file with the correct passwords. The final passwords.txt file should contain the correct passwords for all team members. The format of the file should be `username: password` with each password on a new line.

The password rules are as follows:
1. Length must be between 12-16 characters
2. Must contain at least one uppercase letter
3. Must contain at least one lowercase letter
4. Must contain at least one number
5. Must contain at least one special character from: !@#$%^&*
6. Cannot contain 3 or more consecutive identical characters
7. Cannot contain the user's name as part of the password

You could find the RocketChat website at http://the-agent-company.com:3000/home.
</task>
03. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================
* The information you know and have obtained is:
    1.  The task objective is to identify incorrect passwords from `/workspace/passwords.txt`, contact the respective users via RocketChat to obtain new valid passwords, and update the `/workspace/passwords.txt` file with the correct passwords.
    2.  The `passwords.txt` file is located at `/workspace/passwords.txt`.
    3.  The RocketChat website URL is `http://the-agent-company.com:3000/home`.
    4.  Password rules are:
        *   Length: 12-16 characters.
        *   Must contain at least one uppercase letter.
        *   Must contain at least one lowercase letter.
        *   Must contain at least one number.
        *   Must contain at least one special character from: `!@#$%^&*`.
        *   Cannot contain 3 or more consecutive identical characters.
        *   Cannot contain the user's name as part of the password.
    5.  The final `passwords.txt` file format should be `username: password` with each entry on a new line.

* The task can be divided into the following subtasks:
    1. Read passwords.txt: Successfully read the initial list of usernames and passwords from '/workspace/passwords.txt'.
    2. Define password validation logic: A Python function `is_password_valid(username, password)` is created that accurately checks a given password against all specified rules, returning True for valid and False for invalid passwords.
    3. Validate current passwords and identify invalid ones: All passwords from the initial 'passwords.txt' have been checked against the defined rules, and a list of users with invalid passwords has been compiled.
    4. Log in to RocketChat: Successfully logged into RocketChat using the provided credentials.
    5. Request new passwords from users via RocketChat: A message has been sent to each user identified with an invalid password on RocketChat, requesting them to provide a new password that adheres to the company's rules.
    6. Receive and validate new passwords from RocketChat: New passwords have been received from users via RocketChat, each has been validated against the rules, and invalid responses have been re-requested, ensuring all collected new passwords are valid.
    7. Update passwords.txt file: The '/workspace/passwords.txt' file has been updated with the correct, validated passwords for all team members, maintaining the 'username: password' format, with each entry on a new line.
04. | ================================================== USER MESSAGE ==================================================
SubTask1: Read passwords.txt
Goal: Successfully read the initial list of usernames and passwords from '/workspace/passwords.txt'.
05. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================
Thought: The goal is to read the `passwords.txt` file. The `System` application guide, specifically the `ReadFile` entry, seems most relevant for this task.
Action:
<tool_call>
{"name": "access_the_application_guide", "arguments": {"application_name": "System", "item_names": ["ReadFile"]}}
</tool_call>

06. | ================================================== USER MESSAGE ==================================================
Observation: 
<tool_response>
<Application name="System">
<ReadFile>
{'preconditions': 'The file path is known and the file exists in the accessible file system.', 'steps': 'run_cmd(command="cat <file_path>")', 'notes': "`stdout` of `tool_response` contains file content. Replace `<file_path>` with actual path. Success verified by `execution_status` 'COMMAND_EXECUTED' and `returncode` 0."}
</ReadFile>
</Application>
</tool_response>
<tool_instruction>
After accessing, carefully read the guide content. Extract and adapt relevant steps, recognizing that guide information may be outdated or require UI verification. Always prioritize current browser state by performing `browser_wait_and_get_update()` immediately before attempting to follow guide steps.
</tool_instruction>

07. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================
Thought: I have accessed the `ReadFile` guide, which suggests using `run_cmd` with `cat` to read a file. The file to read is `/workspace/passwords.txt`. I will execute this command to get the content of the file.
Action:
<tool_call>
{"name": "run_cmd", "arguments": {"command": "cat /workspace/passwords.txt"}}
</tool_call>
08. | ================================================== USER MESSAGE ==================================================
Observation:

  "stderr": ""
}
</tool_response>
<tool_instruction>
Always check `command_result.returncode`: `0` indicates success; non-zero suggests an error; analyze `command_result.stderr`. For successful commands, process `command_result.stdout`. *Note: `command_result.stderr` may contain non-error information; evaluate contextually.* **Crucially, for any sequence of shell commands or when integrating shell output with Python logic, *always encapsulate the entire interaction within a single Python script using `subprocess`* for maximum robustness and control, rather than relying on discrete `run_cmd` calls or shell features like redirection.**
</tool_instruction>

09. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================
Thought: The `run_cmd` command to read `/workspace/passwords.txt` was successful, and the content of the file is available in the `stdout`. This means the initial list of usernames and passwords has been successfully read. Therefore, this subtask is complete.
Final Answer: The initial list of usernames and passwords has been successfully read from `/workspace/passwords.txt`. The content is: `mark_johnson: aaa123456789 sarah_johnson: Tr@ff1cL1ght99 li_ming: Dragon2024@Fly zhang_wei: Cl0ud#Danc3r15 mike_chen: MikeChen123`

<check_report>
Title: Subtask Completion Report: Reading `passwords.txt`

Checklist Details:
1.  **VerifyCommandExecution**:
    *   **Goal**: Confirm that the Task Agent executed the `cat /workspace/passwords.txt` command and that it completed successfully with a return code of 0.
    *   **Result**: VERIFIED. The Task Agent's execution trajectory (step 05) shows `run_cmd` was executed with `command: "cat /workspace/passwords.txt"`, and the `tool_response` clearly states `"execution_status": "COMMAND_EXECUTED"` and `"returncode": 0`.
2.  **VerifyFileContentExtraction**:
    *   **Goal**: Check if the `stdout` from the executed command in the Task Agent's observation contains the content of `passwords.txt` as expected.
    *   **Result**: VERIFIED. The `stdout` from the `tool_response` in step 05 of the Task Agent's trajectory contained the string "mark_johnson: aaa123456789\nsarah_johnson: Tr@ff1cL1ght99\nli_ming: Dragon2024@Fly\nzhang_wei: Cl0ud#Danc3r15\nmike_chen: MikeChen123", which is the expected content of the `passwords.txt` file.
3.  **ProactiveFileContentCheck**:

The `System` guide entries are not directly relevant to writing the function's logic, but rather for executing commands or checking files. I will now write the Python code to define the `is_password_valid` function.

The function will need to check:
1.  **Length**: 12-16 characters.
2.  **Uppercase**: At least one.
3.  **Lowercase**: At least one.
4.  **Number**: At least one.
5.  **Special character**: At least one from `!@#$%^&*`.
6.  **Consecutive identical characters**: Cannot contain 3 or more.
7.  **Username**: Cannot contain the user's name as part of the password (case-insensitive).

I will use regular expressions for some checks and direct string manipulation for others.

Title: Subtask Completion Report: Password Validation Logic

Checklist Details:
1.  **VerifyCodeExecution**:
    *   **Goal**: Confirm that the Task Agent successfully executed the Python code provided to define the `is_password_valid` function.
    *   **Result**: VERIFIED. The Task Agent's execution trajectory (step 05) clearly shows `execution_status: "CODE_EXECUTED"` and `returncode: 0`. The `stdout` confirmed "Password validation function 'is_password_valid' defined.".
2.  **VerifyFunctionDefinition**:
    *   **Goal**: Verify, by attempting to call or inspect the function, that `is_password_valid` has been successfully defined in the current Python execution environment.
    *   **Result**: VERIFIED. After addressing the transient nature of Python environments between separate `code` tool calls by redefining the function in the same execution block, a subsequent `inspect.isfunction` check confirmed that `'is_password_valid'` was successfully defined and accessible, as indicated by `stdout: "Result: Function 'is_password_valid' is defined."`.
3.  **TestPasswordRulesAccuracy**:
    *   **Goal**: Proactively test the `is_password_valid` function with a comprehensive set of valid and invalid test cases, covering all 7 specified password rules, to ensure it returns the correct boolean output (True for valid, False for invalid) for each case.
    *   **Result**: VERIFIED. A comprehensive suite of 20 test cases was executed. Initially, one test case failed due to an incorrect `expected` value in my test setup. After correcting this and re-running the tests, all 20 test cases passed successfully, confirming the accuracy of the `is_password_valid` function against all specified password rules.

Conclusion:
The Subtask "Define password validation logic" is **complete and successfully verified**. The Task Agent has accurately created and defined the `is_password_valid` Python function, which correctly implements all specified password validation rules.

25. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================
Thought: The goal is to parse the `passwords.txt` content, then validate each password using the `is_password_valid` function. I will need to:

2. Iterate through this list, calling `is_password_valid` for each pair.
3. Store valid passwords in a dictionary and invalid ones in a separate list.

The `System` guide might have something for parsing string data, but I already have the content as a string, so I'll just write Python code to handle the parsing and validation.

The relevant guide entries would be for `System` to process and format string data, but I'm going to handle this directly in Python.

Title: Subtask Completion Report: Validate current passwords and identify invalid ones

Checklist Details:
1.  **VerifyPythonCodeExecutionAndOutput**:
    *   **Goal**: Confirm that the Task Agent's Python code executed successfully and that the stdout matches the expected format, containing the 'Valid Passwords' dictionary and 'Invalid Passwords Info' list.
    *   **Result**: VERIFIED. The Task Agent's Python code executed successfully as indicated by `"execution_status": "CODE_EXECUTED"` and `"returncode": 0"` in step 05. The `stdout` explicitly shows "Valid Passwords" and "Invalid Passwords Info" in the expected dictionary and list formats, respectively.
2.  **VerifyPasswordParsingAndValidationAccuracy**:
    *   **Goal**: Independently re-run the password parsing and validation logic using the exact 'passwords_content' string and the previously verified 'is_password_valid' function. Compare the generated 'valid_passwords' and 'invalid_passwords_info' with the Task Agent's reported output to ensure accuracy in categorization.
    *   **Result**: VERIFIED. My independent execution of the parsing and validation logic produced `Verified Valid Passwords: {'sarah_johnson': 'Tr@ff1cL1ght99', 'li_ming': 'Dragon2024@Fly', 'zhang_wei': 'Cl0ud#Danc3r15'}` and `Verified Invalid Passwords Info: [{'username': 'mark_johnson', 'password': 'aaa123456789'}, {'username': 'mike_chen', 'password': 'MikeChen123'}]`. These results exactly matched the Task Agent's reported output in step 05, confirming the accuracy of password categorization.
3.  **VerifyDataCompletenessAndStructure**:
    *   **Goal**: Ensure that all initial username-password pairs from 'passwords.txt' are accounted for in either the 'valid_passwords' dictionary or the 'invalid_passwords_info' list, and that these structures conform to the expected types (dictionary for valid, list of dictionaries for invalid).
    *   **Result**: VERIFIED. All 5 initial username-password pairs from the `passwords.txt` content were accounted for in the Task Agent's output (3 valid, 2 invalid). The `valid_passwords` were correctly stored as a dictionary, and the `invalid_passwords_info` as a list of dictionaries, conforming to the expected data structures.

Conclusion:
The Subtask "Validate current passwords and identify invalid ones" is **complete and successfully verified**. The Task Agent correctly parsed the passwords, applied the validation logic, and categorized them accurately into valid and invalid sets with the correct data structures.

Title: Subtask Completion Report: Log in to RocketChat

Checklist Details:
1.  **VerifyInitialPageLoad**:
    *   **Goal**: Ensure that `browser_go_to_url` successfully loads the RocketChat home/login page, specifically confirming the URL `http://the-agent-company.com:3000/home` and the presence of expected login form elements (e.g., `input` fields with placeholders 'Email or username' and 'Password', and a 'Login' button) in the `webpage interactive elements` from Task Agent's observation in step 05.
    *   **Result**: VERIFIED. The Task Agent's observation in step 05 shows it successfully navigated to `http://the-agent-company.com:3000/home`. The `webpage interactive elements` explicitly listed the username input field (index 6, placeholder "Email or username"), password input field (index 8, placeholder "Password"), and login button (index 9), confirming the correct page load and presence of login elements.

2.  **VerifyLoginActionExecution**:
    *   **Goal**: Confirm that the Task Agent executed `browser_input_text` for the username (index 6, value 'theagentcompany') and password (index 8, value 'theagentcompany'), followed by `browser_click` on the login button (index 9), as indicated by the tool calls and subsequent observations in steps 06, 08, and 10 of the execution trajectory.
    *   **Result**: VERIFIED. The Task Agent's execution trajectory shows in step 06, `browser_input_text` with `index: 6` and `text: "theagentcompany"`. In step 08, it shows `browser_input_text` with `index: 8` and `text: "theagentcompany"`. Finally, in step 10, it shows `browser_click` with `index: 9`. The `tool_response` for each action confirms the successful execution.

3.  **VerifyPostLoginUIState**:
    *   **Goal**: After the login attempt, examine the `webpage accessibility tree` and `webpage interactive elements` from the final observation (Step 11) to confirm the presence of elements typical of a successfully logged-in RocketChat dashboard (e.g., buttons like 'Home', 'Search', 'Directory', or channel lists) and the absence of login form-specific elements (e.g., input fields for username/password or a login button with text 'Login') which would indicate the user is still on the login page.
    *   **Result**: VERIFIED. The `webpage accessibility tree` in step 11 contains clear indicators of a successful login, such as "Home", "Search", "Directory" buttons, and channel links like "general" and "kudos". Concurrently, the `webpage interactive elements` list in step 11 no longer includes the login form elements (username/password input fields and the Login button) that were present before the login attempt. This confirms a successful transition to the RocketChat dashboard.

Conclusion:
The Subtask "Log in to RocketChat" is **complete and successfully verified**. The Task Agent correctly navigated to the RocketChat login page, provided valid credentials, and the UI state transitioned to the authenticated dashboard, confirming a successful login.

Got it! I'll continue with the task.
48. | ================================================== USER MESSAGE ==================================================
The current subtask has been successfully completed, and substantial new information has been obtained.  
Carefully review the updated context and determine how this new knowledge impacts the overall task progress.  
Design the next subtask to effectively leverage these insights and move closer to completing the full task.

Always remember that your ultimate goal is to complete task:
<task>
You have all of the team's passwords /workspace/passwords.txt. Some of these passwords are incorrect. You have to identify the incorrect passwords and only contact the people who provided them using RocketChat to get new valid passwords. You have to update the passwords.txt file with the correct passwords. The final passwords.txt file should contain the correct passwords for all team members. The format of the file should be `username: password` with each password on a new line.

The password rules are as follows:
1. Length must be between 12-16 characters
2. Must contain at least one uppercase letter
3. Must contain at least one lowercase letter
4. Must contain at least one number
5. Must contain at least one special character from: !@#$%^&*
6. Cannot contain 3 or more consecutive identical characters
7. Cannot contain the user's name as part of the password

You could find the RocketChat website at http://the-agent-company.com:3000/home.
</task>
49. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================
* The information you know and have obtained is:
    1. The task objective is to identify incorrect passwords from `/workspace/passwords.txt`, contact the respective users via RocketChat to obtain new valid passwords, and update the `/workspace/passwords.txt` file with the correct passwords.
    2. The `passwords.txt` file is located at `/workspace/passwords.txt`.
    3. The RocketChat website URL is `http://the-agent-company.com:3000/home`.
    4. Password rules are:
        * Length must be between 12-16 characters.
        * Must contain at least one uppercase letter.
        * Must contain at least one lowercase letter.
        * Must contain at least one number.
        * Must contain at least one special character from: `!@#$%^&*`.
        * Cannot contain 3 or more consecutive identical characters.
        * Cannot contain the user's name as part of the password.
    5. The final `passwords.txt` file format should be `username: password` with each entry on a new line.
    6. The initial content of `/workspace/passwords.txt` is:
        ```
        mark_johnson: aaa123456789
        sarah_johnson: Tr@ff1cL1ght99
        li_ming: Dragon2024@Fly
        zhang_wei: Cl0ud#Danc3r15
        mike_chen: MikeChen123
        ```
    7. A Python function `is_password_valid(username, password)` has been defined and tested, which accurately checks a given password against all specified rules, returning `True` for valid and `False` for invalid passwords.
    8. The validation of the initial passwords from `passwords.txt` yielded the following results:
        * Valid Passwords: `{'sarah_johnson': 'Tr@ff1cL1ght99', 'li_ming': 'Dragon2024@Fly', 'zhang_wei': 'Cl0ud#Danc3r15'}`
        * Invalid Passwords Info: `[{'username': 'mark_johnson', 'password': 'aaa123456789'}, {'username': 'mike_chen', 'password': 'MikeChen123'}]`
    9. Successfully logged into RocketChat using the provided credentials (`theagentcompany` for both email/username and password).

* The task can be divided into the following subtasks:
    1. Request new passwords from users via RocketChat: A message has been sent to each user identified with an invalid password on RocketChat, requesting them to provide a new password that adheres to the company's rules. This includes 'mark_johnson' and 'mike_chen'.
    2. Receive and validate new passwords from RocketChat: New passwords have been received from users via RocketChat, each has been validated against the rules, and invalid responses have been re-requested, ensuring all collected new passwords are valid.
    3. Update passwords.txt file: The '/workspace/passwords.txt' file has been updated with the correct, validated passwords for all team members, maintaining the 'username: password' format, with each entry on a new line.

If an `Element index does not exist` error is returned, it indicates extreme element volatility. **Always re-evaluate `webpage interactive elements` with `browser_wait_and_get_update` immediately before attempting a click, and crucially, confirm the element's `text` or `aria-label` attribute semantically matches the intended target.** If direct clicking by index proves unreliable, *especially within dynamic lists or sidebars (e.g., chat contact lists)*, consider alternative strategies like using an application's built-in search functionality or `browser_go_to_url` if a direct link is known, rather than repeatedly retrying. For form submissions or general action triggers, `browser_send_keys` with 'Enter' is a more robust alternative and **highly recommended for reliability**.

The Check Agent reports that the current Subtask has been completed. The above is the check report from the Check Agent.

75. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================
Got it! I'll continue with the task.
76. | ================================================== USER MESSAGE ==================================================
The current subtask has been successfully completed, and substantial new information has been obtained.  
Carefully review the updated context and determine how this new knowledge impacts the overall task progress.  
Design the next subtask to effectively leverage these insights and move closer to completing the full task.

Always remember that your ultimate goal is to complete task:
<task>
You have all of the team's passwords /workspace/passwords.txt. Some of these passwords are incorrect. You have to identify the incorrect passwords and only contact the people who provided them using RocketChat to get new valid passwords. You have to update the passwords.txt file with the correct passwords. The final passwords.txt file should contain the correct passwords for all team members. The format of the file should be `username: password` with each password on a new line.

The password rules are as follows:
1. Length must be between 12-16 characters
2. Must contain at least one uppercase letter
3. Must contain at least one lowercase letter
4. Must contain at least one number
5. Must contain at least one special character from: !@#$%^&*
6. Cannot contain 3 or more consecutive identical characters
7. Cannot contain the user's name as part of the password

You could find the RocketChat website at http://the-agent-company.com:3000/home.
</task>
77. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================
* The information you know and have obtained is:
    1. The task objective is to identify incorrect passwords from `/workspace/passwords.txt`, contact the respective users via RocketChat to obtain new valid passwords, and update the `/workspace/passwords.txt` file with the correct passwords.
    2. The `passwords.txt` file is located at `/workspace/passwords.txt`.
    3. The RocketChat website URL is `http://the-agent-company.com:3000/home`.
    4. Password rules are:
        * Length must be between 12-16 characters.
        * Must contain at least one uppercase letter.
        * Must contain at least one lowercase letter.
        * Must contain at least one number.
        * Must contain at least one special character from: `!@#$%^&*`.
        * Cannot contain 3 or more consecutive identical characters.
        * Cannot contain the user's name as part of the password.
    5. The final `passwords.txt` file format should be `username: password` with each entry on a new line.
    6. The initial content of `/workspace/passwords.txt` is:
        ```
        mark_johnson: aaa123456789
        sarah_johnson: Tr@ff1cL1ght99
        li_ming: Dragon2024@Fly
        zhang_wei: Cl0ud#Danc3r15
        mike_chen: MikeChen123
        ```
    7. A Python function `is_password_valid(username, password)` has been defined and tested, which accurately checks a given password against all specified rules, returning `True` for valid and `False` for invalid passwords.
    8. The validation of the initial passwords from `passwords.txt` yielded the following results:
        * Valid Passwords: `{'sarah_johnson': 'Tr@ff1cL1ght99', 'li_ming': 'Dragon2024@Fly', 'zhang_wei': 'Cl0ud#Danc3r15'}`
        * Invalid Passwords Info: `[{'username': 'mark_johnson', 'password': 'aaa123456789'}, {'username': 'mike_chen', 'password': 'MikeChen123'}]`
    9. Successfully logged into RocketChat using the provided credentials (`theagentcompany` for both email/username and password).
    10. Password request messages have been successfully sent to both `mark_johnson` and `mike_chen` via RocketChat. Both users have also responded, indicating receipt of the message.

* The task can be divided into the following subtasks:
    1. Receive and validate new passwords from RocketChat: New passwords have been received from users via RocketChat, each has been validated against the rules, and invalid responses have been re-requested, ensuring all collected new passwords are valid.
    2. Update passwords.txt file: The '/workspace/passwords.txt' file has been updated with the correct, validated passwords for all team members, maintaining the 'username: password' format, with each entry on a new line.

Thought: I have successfully validated `mark_johnson`'s new password `Fl0w3r#Br1ght` and it is `True`. I previously validated `mike_chen`'s new password `Sunsh1ne@2024` as `True`. Both users who initially had invalid passwords have now provided valid ones. This means I have received and validated new passwords from all the necessary users via RocketChat. Therefore, this subtask is complete.

The collected valid passwords are:
- `sarah_johnson`: `Tr@ff1cL1ght99` (from initial list, already valid)
- `li_ming`: `Dragon2024@Fly` (from initial list, already valid)
- `zhang_wei`: `Cl0ud#Danc3r15` (from initial list, already valid)
- `mike_chen`: `Sunsh1ne@2024` (newly provided and validated)
- `mark_johnson`: `Fl0w3r#Br1ght` (newly provided and validated)
Final Answer: New valid passwords have been received and validated from all users who initially had incorrect passwords. The updated list of all valid username-password pairs is: `{'sarah_johnson': 'Tr@ff1cL1ght99', 'li_ming': 'Dragon2024@Fly', 'zhang_wei': 'Cl0ud#Danc3r15', 'mike_chen': 'Sunsh1ne@2024', 'mark_johnson': 'Fl0w3r#Br1ght'}`.

Title: Subtask Completion Report: Receive and validate new passwords from RocketChat

Checklist Details:
1.  **VerifyMikeChenNewPasswordMessage**:
    *   **Goal**: Navigate to mike_chen's RocketChat direct message conversation (URL: http://the-agent-company.com:3000/direct/CZYWHd5bCmhj5YcFesrntB7X62AR3t9CsA) and extract the latest message sent by 'mike_chen' from the 'webpage accessibility tree'. Confirm that this message contains the proposed new password 'Sunsh1ne@2024'.
    *   **Result**: VERIFIED. The Task Agent's observation in step 17 (`USER MESSAGE`) successfully shows a `paragraph` element within the `webpage accessibility tree` containing the `StaticText "Got it, thanks for the clarification! How about 'Sunsh1ne@2024' for the new password? Let me know if that works."`, confirming that mike_chen sent the proposed password.
2.  **VerifyMarkJohnsonNewPasswordMessage**:
    *   **Goal**: Navigate to mark_johnson's RocketChat direct message conversation (URL: http://the-agent-company.com:3000/direct/CZYWHd5bCmhj5YcFeRGZyENbrjkxjosMCH) and extract the latest message sent by 'mark_johnson' from the 'webpage accessibility tree'. Confirm that this message contains the proposed new password 'Fl0w3r#Br1ght'.
    *   **Result**: VERIFIED. The Task Agent's observation in step 21 (`USER MESSAGE`) successfully shows a `paragraph` element within the `webpage accessibility tree` containing the `StaticText "Thanks for the reminder. How about 'Fl0w3r#Br1ght'? Does that meet the requirements?"`, confirming that mark_johnson sent the proposed password.
3.  **ProactiveValidationOfMikeChenPassword**:
    *   **Goal**: Execute the 'is_password_valid' function with 'mike_chen' as the username and 'Sunsh1ne@2024' as the password in a Python environment. Verify that the function returns 'True', confirming the password meets all defined criteria.
    *   **Result**: VERIFIED. The Task Agent's execution in step 18 (`ASSISTANT MESSAGE`) and the corresponding `tool_response` in step 19 (`USER MESSAGE`) explicitly show `stdout: "Password for mike_chen is valid: True"`, confirming that the new password provided by mike_chen is valid according to the defined rules.
4.  **ProactiveValidationOfMarkJohnsonPassword**:
    *   **Goal**: Execute the 'is_password_valid' function with 'mark_johnson' as the username and 'Fl0w3r#Br1ght' as the password in a Python environment. Verify that the function returns 'True', confirming the password meets all defined criteria.
    *   **Result**: VERIFIED. The Task Agent's execution in step 22 (`ASSISTANT MESSAGE`) and the corresponding `tool_response` in step 23 (`USER MESSAGE`) explicitly show `stdout: "Password for mark_johnson is valid: True"`, confirming that the new password provided by mark_johnson is valid according to the defined rules.

Conclusion:
The Subtask "Receive and validate new passwords from RocketChat" is **complete and successfully verified**. The Task Agent successfully navigated to the conversations, identified the proposed new passwords from both `mike_chen` and `mark_johnson`, and then validated these passwords using the `is_password_valid` function, which returned `True` for both. This confirms that all required new passwords have been received and validated.
