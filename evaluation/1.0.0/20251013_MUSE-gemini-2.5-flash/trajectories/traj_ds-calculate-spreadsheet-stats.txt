# ACTION #
During task execution, you can perform **Actions**, including:
1. **Tool Call**
2. **Python Code Execution**

## Action Output Format
1. **Tool Call**
When calling a tool, please output:
<tool_call>
{"name": "<function-name>", "arguments": <args-json-object>}
</tool_call>
- `<function-name>`: Tool function name
- `<args-json-object>`: Call arguments (JSON format)
- If multiple `<tool_call>` are output at once, only the first one will be executed; the rest will be ignored.

Available tool signatures are provided within the `<tools>` tag:
<tools>
{"type": "function", "function": {"name": "extract_image_content_by_gpt4o", "description": "Utilizes `gpt-4o` to interpret and extract content from local image files (e.g., PNG, JPEG). Highly effective for **scanned documents, image-based PDFs (post-conversion to image formats),** or visual data. For optimal extraction, craft precise queries. **Caution: While effective for general content, direct numerical or highly structured extraction from complex visual elements (e.g., tally marks, handwritten notes) may be imprecise; robust post-processing is often required. For multi-page documents, convert each page into a separate image and ensure *all* generated image pages are processed for complete data extraction.**", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"image_path": {"type": "string", "description": "Local image path."}, "query": {"type": "string", "description": "Query to the gpt-4o to get the image content."}}, "required": ["image_path", "query"]}}}

Element indices are dynamic and highly volatile; always verify the target element's existence and index using `browser_wait_and_get_update` immediately before clicking. Be aware that even with immediate updates, indices can shift in very dynamic UIs. Crucially, after clicking, always use `browser_wait_and_get_update` to immediately re-evaluate the page state and confirm the intended effect (e.g., UI changes, navigation). For navigation, `browser_go_to_url` is a more robust alternative when a direct URL is known. For form submissions or general action triggers, `browser_send_keys` with 'Enter' is often a more robust alternative, especially when direct clicking by index proves unreliable. Avoid clicking elements that are not currently visible or interactable.", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"index": {"type": "integer", "description": "The index number of the target element."}}, "required": ["index"]}}}

It cannot process content that is scrolled out of view or exists on other pages of a paginated list. While `accessibility tree` and `interactive elements` are primary for UI understanding, this visual tool can be a highly effective *primary* method for text extraction in challenging scenarios. **Crucially, for critical or structured data (e.g., IDs, specific names, numerical values), always cross-verify with or prefer extraction from the `webpage accessibility tree` as visual interpretation may introduce inaccuracies, especially for abbreviated or visually ambiguous elements.**", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"query": {"type": "string", "description": "Query to the VL model to get the browser page content."}}, "required": ["query"]}}}

</tools>

2. **Python Code Execution**
When executing Python code, please output:
<code>
... your code ...
</code>
- The working directory is `/workspace`
- Executing dangerous, destructive, or time-consuming code is prohibited.
- If both a **Tool Call** and **Python Code Execution** are included in the output, the tool call takes precedence, and the Python code will not be executed.
- Using outdated or limited python libraries may result in incomplete or inaccurate observations (e.g. missing images from PDFs or failing to extract key content). Always prefer robust, modern libraries to ensure full and reliable results.
- When performing file conversion or data extraction, always ensure **data integrity**. Verify that the structure, content, and critical fields of the source file are preserved in the output. Check row and column counts, headers, and key values before and after processing. **Avoid silent loss**, truncation, or unintended alteration of data.

## Action Execution Result Processing
- After each action is executed, an Observation is returned, which includes:
    1. `<tool_response>`: The result of the tool or code execution.
    2. `<tool_instruction>`: The instruction associated with a specific action, used to guide the next step or restrict subsequent behavior.
- **Note**: Do not fabricate observations.

## Security and Restrictions
- **Coding Actions (such as Python, CMD, etc.)**
    - Do not run high-risk operations that are large in code size or take a long time.
    - Do not execute code that could cause data loss, system damage, or irreversible changes.
    - Do not use the kill command with wildcards like * or other dangerous parameters that could result in a wide range of matches.
    - Prefer using the Python interpreter to execute code (safer and more efficient) rather than using the CMD tool.

> ⚠️ **Important**
> When your output contains content that fully conforms to the **Tool Call** or **Python Code Execution** format, the system will immediately parse, identify, and execute it as an **Action** without further confirmation and without reversal.
> Therefore, before outputting, always confirm that this is your **intended** action and fully assess the potential consequences and risks.
> If you are only using **quotes, demonstrations, or examples**, be sure to break the formatting or escape it to prevent the system from interpreting it as a real action.

# OBJECTIVE #
Your core objective is to independently and efficiently complete the tasks assigned to you by the company.


# MEMORY #
During previous tasks, you have accumulated the following reusable knowledge:

## Resolution Patterns
Comprehensive Contextualization: Systematically acquire and aggregate information from diverse, potentially unstructured sources, prioritizing local processing and cross-validation, to ensure a complete, coherent operational view and inform robust decisions.
Robust External Interaction: Prioritize stable, predictable interaction methods, such as structured APIs, and dynamically adapt strategies to ensure continuity and reliability with external systems despite their inconsistencies or volatility.
Adaptive Constraint Handling: When an objective is blocked by an unresolvable external constraint, acknowledge the limitation, perform necessary cleanup of partial artifacts, and adapt the strategy to proceed with viable data, avoiding unproductive retries.
Modular Resilient Design: Decompose operations into modular, decoupled units with explicit state management, to enhance predictability, isolate errors, improve maintainability, and ensure operational continuity.
Progressive Verification: Implement multi-stage validation, from granular checks within pipelines to comprehensive outcome validation, to localize errors, confirm system states, and ensure successful execution.

## Platform/Application Operation Guides
These guides summarize proven operation paths derived from past successful experiences.  
Each item is a structured reference designed to help you complete operations more quickly, accurately, and with reduced redundancy.

> This directory provides a comprehensive index of guides, compiling best practices and experience summaries for accomplishing various tasks.

### Recommended Usage Process
1. **Review the Guide First**  
   Before starting a task, browse the relevant entries in the directory to identify potentially useful guidance.  
2. **Targeted Access**  
   Use the `access_the_application_guide` tool to view detailed steps if necessary.  
3. **Reuse with Flexibility**  
   Apply past successful steps when they fit the current situation, but stay aware of possible mismatches.  
4. **Explore When Deviations Arise**  
   If the environment or results diverge from the guide, stop rigidly following it and explore alternative approaches through small, safe, and adaptive steps.

### Value of Guides
- Reduce task completion time by leveraging accumulated experience.  
- Lower error rates and avoid common pitfalls.  
- Ensure consistent, professional execution of tasks.  

### Guide Reliability & Adaptation
- Guides may be outdated, biased, or contain errors — they are “historical experience,” not absolute truth.  
- Use guides as starting points, not as strict rules.  
- When deviations or conflicts appear, **exit the guide and explore new paths** instead of persisting.  
- Record useful deviation points for later improvement of the guides.

<task>
Check all the spreadsheet under the "Data Analysis" folder at http://the-agent-company.com:8092?dir=/Documents
Write a python program to calculate the average number of rows and columns for all the spreadsheet files. If a file has multiple sheets, count all the tables in all sheets. Save your python script to "/workspace/data_stats.py" as reference for the calculation process.

Then, inform Jessica Lee that you have finished the analysis. Send her the statistics in the format:
Average Rows: Average Number of Rows rounded of 2 decimal places
Average Columns: Average Number of Columns rounded of 2 decimal places

Also, send her a message on http://the-agent-company.com:3000/ saying "Analysis Finished. Script can be found at script_path" Replace script_path with the path of the data anlysis script.
</task>
03. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================
* The information you know and have obtained is:
    1.  The task requires checking spreadsheet files under the "/Documents/Data Analysis" folder in OwnCloud (`http://the-agent-company.com:8092`).
    2.  A Python program needs to be written to calculate the average number of rows and columns for all tables across all sheets in these spreadsheet files.
    3.  The Python script must be saved to "/workspace/data_stats.py".
    4.  The calculated statistics (average rows and average columns, rounded to 2 decimal places) need to be sent to Jessica Lee.
    5.  A message "Analysis Finished. Script can be found at script_path" (where script_path is `/workspace/data_stats.py`) needs to be sent on RocketChat (`http://the-agent-company.com:3000/`).
    6.  The OwnCloud credentials are `username: theagentcompany`, `password: theagentcompany`.

Thought: The previous `browser_click` action resulted in a `TimeoutError`. However, the guide mentions that a timeout during login might not indicate failure and that login could complete in the background. Therefore, I need to verify the current state of the page to determine if the login was successful. I will use `browser_wait_and_get_update` with a 3-second delay to refresh the page state and check for indicators of a successful login, such as a URL change or the presence of file management elements.

Thought: The `TimeoutError` from the previous `browser_click` was a false negative. The current URL and the content of the `webpage accessibility tree` clearly indicate that the login was successful. The page now shows the file management interface, including folders like "Documents", "Downloads", and "Photos", and the logged-in username "theagentcompany". This confirms that I have successfully logged into OwnCloud.

Title: OwnCloud Login Verification Report

Checklist Details:
- **Verify Current URL Post-Login**: Verified. The current URL from Observation 13 (`http://the-agent-company.com:8092/index.php/apps/files/?dir=%2F&fileid=5`) matches the expected URL pattern for a successful OwnCloud login, indicating navigation beyond the login page.
- **Verify Presence of Key Post-Login UI Elements**: Verified. The `webpage accessibility tree` in Observation 13 contains "Files - ownCloud" as the main page title, displays "theagentcompany" as the logged-in username, and includes file management links such as "Documents", "Downloads", and "Photos", confirming the UI has transitioned to a fully authenticated state.

Thought: I have reviewed the `DownloadFile` guide. It states that I can use `wget` with the WebDAV URL. The WebDAV URL is `http://the-agent-company.com:8092/remote.php/webdav/<full_path_to_file>`. I have the list of filenames and the base directory `/Documents/Data Analysis`. I need to construct the full WebDAV URL for each file and then use `wget` to download each file to the `/workspace` directory. The filenames extracted in the previous step already handle URL encoding for spaces (e.g., `Beverage%20Comparison%202004%20and%202015.xlsx`), so I can use them directly in the URL construction.

I will write a Python script to:
1. Define the list of filenames.
2. Define the OwnCloud URL and credentials.
3. Loop through each filename.
4. Construct the `webdav_url` for each file.
5. Construct the `local_file_path` in `/workspace`.
6. Construct the `wget` command with username, password, webdav_url, and local_file_path.
7. Execute the `wget` command using `run_cmd`.
8. After downloading all files, I will verify their presence in `/workspace`.

The `tool_instruction` advises encapsulating sequences of shell commands within a single Python script using `subprocess` for robustness. I have a list of 20 files to download. Therefore, I will write a Python script that iterates through the list of filenames, constructs the `wget` command for each, and executes it using `subprocess.run`. This will ensure all files are downloaded in a robust manner.

I will define the list of files, the OwnCloud base URL, WebDAV path, username, and password within the Python script. Then, for each file, I will construct the `webdav_url` and `local_file_path`, and execute the `wget` command using `subprocess.run`. I will also add error handling and print statements to monitor the download process.

Thought: The current subtask is to develop a Python script (`data_stats.py`) that calculates the average number of rows and columns from all downloaded spreadsheet files. This script will need to read Excel files, handle multiple sheets, count rows and columns, and then calculate and print the averages.

I will need to use `System: WriteFile` to save the script. For reading Excel files, `System: ReadExcelFileIntoDataFrame` seems most appropriate. I should also consider how to handle different sheets within an Excel file and how to determine the "effective" number of rows and columns (i.e., actual data rows/columns, not just the maximum dimensions of the sheet).

I will start by accessing the guides for `System: WriteFile` and `System: ReadExcelFileIntoDataFrame`.

For complex layouts, *explicitly defining header components and using string-based content identification for rows (e.g., filtering for specific category names) or precise `iloc` slicing based on visual inspection* is often more robust than relying on generic `skiprows` or fixed `header` indices, especially when row indices might shift or header rows are intermingled with data. The iterative `pd.to_numeric` with `errors='coerce'` handles conversion gracefully. Use `.copy()` after filtering/slicing to avoid `SettingWithCopyWarning`. For standard layouts where the first row is the header, `header=0` can be directly applied. When formatting date columns, ensure the column is already of `datetime` dtype, otherwise convert it first (e.g., `pd.to_datetime(df_processed['<Date_Column>'])`)."}

The `pip install` command executed successfully, and `xlrd` was installed, while `pandas` and `openpyxl` were already present. This confirms that all necessary libraries for processing Excel files are available.

Now I will write the Python script `data_stats.py` as planned. The script will iterate through all `.xlsx` and `.xls` files in the `/workspace` directory, read each sheet into a pandas DataFrame, clean it by dropping entirely empty rows and columns, and then sum up the effective rows and columns. Finally, it will calculate and print the average rows and columns across all sheets/tables found. I will use `System: WriteFile` to save this script to `/workspace/data_stats.py`.

Thought: The previous attempt to create `data_stats.py` using `run_cmd` and `python -c` failed due to a `SyntaxError`. This approach is error-prone for complex Python code. As per the `tool_instruction` and best practices, I should directly use a Python code block to write the script content to the file. This is a more robust way to create the file. The subtask is not yet complete as the script has not been successfully written.

I will now write the Python code directly to `/workspace/data_stats.py`.

Thought: The Python script `data_stats.py` has been successfully created and saved in `/workspace` as confirmed by the `tool_response` and the `stdout`. This directly fulfills the goal of Subtask5: "Create a Python script named 'data_stats.py' in '/workspace' that can read all downloaded spreadsheet files, iterate through all sheets within each file, determine the effective number of rows and columns for each sheet's data, aggregate these counts across all files, and compute the overall average rows and columns, printing these averages to standard output. The script should be saved at '/workspace/data_stats.py'."
Final Answer: The Python script `data_stats.py` has been successfully created and saved in `/workspace`.

Title: Develop Data Analysis Script Verification Report

Checklist Details:
- **Verify Script File Existence**: Verified. The `ls -l /workspace` command (Observation 1) confirmed the presence of `data_stats.py` at `/workspace`, fulfilling the requirement for the script to be saved at this path.
- **Verify Script File Content**: Verified. The `cat /workspace/data_stats.py` command (Observation 3) retrieved the script content. This content was found to be identical to the Python script provided by the Task Agent in Action 8, which includes the logic for iterating through spreadsheet files and sheets, cleaning data, and calculating average rows and columns as specified.
- **Verify Script Executability and Output**: Verified. Executing the script via `python /workspace/data_stats.py` (Observation 5) resulted in a `returncode: 0`, indicating successful execution. The `stdout` (`Average Rows: 21.90\nAverage Columns: 8.52`) demonstrates that the script correctly calculated and printed the average rows and columns, formatted to two decimal places, matching the subtask's output requirements.

Conclusion:
The Subtask "Develop Data Analysis Script" is complete. The Task Agent successfully created the `data_stats.py` script at the specified location, with the correct content and functionality to calculate the average number of rows and columns from the downloaded spreadsheet files, and it executes without errors, producing the expected output.

The current subtask has been successfully completed, and substantial new information has been obtained.  
Carefully review the updated context and determine how this new knowledge impacts the overall task progress.  
Design the next subtask to effectively leverage these insights and move closer to completing the full task.

Always remember that your ultimate goal is to complete task:
<task>
Check all the spreadsheet under the "Data Analysis" folder at http://the-agent-company.com:8092?dir=/Documents
Write a python program to calculate the average number of rows and columns for all the spreadsheet files. If a file has multiple sheets, count all the tables in all sheets. Save your python script to "/workspace/data_stats.py" as reference for the calculation process.

Then, inform Jessica Lee that you have finished the analysis. Send her the statistics in the format:
Average Rows: Average Number of Rows rounded of 2 decimal places
Average Columns: Average Number of Columns rounded of 2 decimal places

Also, send her a message on http://the-agent-company.com:3000/ saying "Analysis Finished. Script can be found at script_path" Replace script_path with the path of the data anlysis script.

If an `Element index does not exist` error is returned, it indicates extreme element volatility. **Always re-evaluate `webpage interactive elements` with `browser_wait_and_get_update` immediately before attempting a click, and crucially, confirm the element's `text` or `aria-label` attribute semantically matches the intended target.** If direct clicking by index proves unreliable, *especially within dynamic lists or sidebars (e.g., chat contact lists)*, consider alternative strategies like using an application's built-in search functionality or `browser_go_to_url` if a direct link is known, rather than repeatedly retrying. For form submissions or general action triggers, `browser_send_keys` with 'Enter' is a more robust alternative and **highly recommended for reliability**.
</tool_instruction>

83. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================
Thought: I have successfully clicked the login button. The `webpage accessibility tree` now shows elements like "Home", "Search", "Directory", "Channels", and "Direct Messages", which are typical of a logged-in RocketChat interface. The login form elements are no longer present in `webpage interactive elements`. This indicates that the login was successful.
Final Answer: Successfully logged in to RocketChat.

Title: RocketChat Login Verification Report

Checklist Details:
- **Verify Absence of Login Form Elements**: Verified. As observed in Observation 11, the `webpage interactive elements` no longer contain the input fields (with placeholders 'Email or username' and 'Password') or the 'Login' button that were present in Observation 05, confirming their absence post-login. This aligns with the expectation for a successful login, where the login form would no longer be displayed.
- **Verify Presence of Key Post-Login UI Elements**: Verified. The `webpage accessibility tree` in Observation 11 clearly shows elements like 'Home', 'Search', and 'Directory' buttons, the 'Channels' region, and 'Direct Messages' text, which are all indicative of a successfully logged-in RocketChat dashboard. This confirms the appearance of the expected post-login UI, as specified in the RocketChat login guide.

Conclusion:
The Subtask "RocketChat Login" is complete. The Task Agent has successfully logged into the RocketChat instance, as confirmed by the disappearance of login form elements and the appearance of expected post-login UI elements.

The Check Agent reports that the current Subtask has been completed. The above is the check report from the Check Agent.

Title: Send Analysis Completion Message Verification Report

Checklist Details:
- **Verify Chat Context**: Verified. Observation 17 shows the URL `http://the-agent-company.com:3000/direct/4qnpxztMbfyYn3rQACZYWHd5bCmhj5YcFe` and a heading `jessica_lee`, confirming the agent successfully navigated to Jessica Lee's direct message conversation.
- **Verify Message Content**: Verified. The `webpage accessibility tree` in Observation 17 contains three `paragraph` elements: `StaticText 'Analysis Finished.'`, `StaticText 'Average Rows: 21.90'`, and `StaticText 'Average Columns: 8.52'`, confirming the complete message content was sent as intended.
- **Verify Message Sender**: Verified. The `webpage accessibility tree` in Observation 17 clearly shows `StaticText 'theagentcompany'` associated with the sent message, confirming the message was sent by the agent.
- **Verify Input Field Cleared**: Verified. The `textarea` (index 74) in `webpage interactive elements` from Observation 17 has an empty `text` attribute, and the `textbox 'Message'` in the `webpage accessibility tree` is also empty, indicating that the message input field was cleared after sending.

Conclusion:
The Subtask "Send Analysis Completion Message" is complete. The Task Agent successfully sent the analysis completion message, including the average rows and columns, to Jessica Lee on RocketChat, as confirmed by the correct chat context, accurate message content, proper sender attribution, and a cleared input field.

The current subtask has been successfully completed, and substantial new information has been obtained.  
Carefully review the updated context and determine how this new knowledge impacts the overall task progress.  
Design the next subtask to effectively leverage these insights and move closer to completing the full task.

Always remember that your ultimate goal is to complete task:
<task>
Check all the spreadsheet under the "Data Analysis" folder at http://the-agent-company.com:8092?dir=/Documents
Write a python program to calculate the average number of rows and columns for all the spreadsheet files. If a file has multiple sheets, count all the tables in all sheets. Save your python script to "/workspace/data_stats.py" as reference for the calculation process.

Then, inform Jessica Lee that you have finished the analysis. Send her the statistics in the format:
Average Rows: Average Number of Rows rounded of 2 decimal places
Average Columns: Average Number of Columns rounded of 2 decimal places

Also, send her a message on http://the-agent-company.com:3000/ saying "Analysis Finished. Script can be found at script_path" Replace script_path with the path of the data anlysis script.

109. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================
* The information you know and have obtained is:
    1. The core task is to analyze spreadsheet files under the "Data Analysis" folder in OwnCloud, calculate the average number of rows and columns, save a Python script (`data_stats.py`) detailing this analysis, and then send the calculated statistics and the script's path to "Jessica Lee" via RocketChat.
    2. OwnCloud service URL is `http://the-agent-company.com:8092`, with username `theagentcompany` and password `theagentcompany`.
    3. RocketChat service URL is `http://the-agent-company.com:3000`, with email `theagentcompany` and password `theagentcompany`.
    4. Successfully logged into OwnCloud.
    5. Successfully navigated to the `/Documents/Data Analysis` folder within OwnCloud.
    6. A list of 20 spreadsheet file names (e.g., `.xlsx`, `.xls`) was identified in the target folder: `['12.xlsx', '28.xlsx', '1111111.xlsx', 'agriculture.xlsx', 'agriculture_degree.xlsx', 'Beverage%20Comparison%202004%20and%202015.xlsx', 'beverage_nuitrition.xlsx', 'beverage_overtime.xlsx', 'beverage_stats.xlsx', 'Customer.xlsx', 'Diff-in-Energy-Intake.xlsx', 'Energy%20Intake.xlsx', 'Estimated%20energy%20intake.xlsx', 'Estimation%20of%20SD.xlsx', 'farm_land.xlsx', 'Gas%20Emission.xlsx', 'Mean%20daily%20total%20sugars%20intake.xlsx', 'mushroomexports.xlsx', 'Number%20of%20Agri%20Ops.xlsx', 'ontario_agriculture.xlsx']`.
    7. All identified spreadsheet files were successfully downloaded from OwnCloud to the `/workspace` directory.
    8. A Python script named `data_stats.py` was successfully created and saved at `/workspace/data_stats.py`. This script reads spreadsheet files, cleans empty rows/columns, counts effective rows and columns per sheet, and calculates overall averages.
    9. The `data_stats.py` script was executed, and the calculated statistics are: Average Rows: 21.90, Average Columns: 8.52.
    10. Successfully logged into RocketChat.
    11. Successfully sent the analysis completion message containing "Analysis Finished. Average Rows: 21.90 Average Columns: 8.52" to Jessica Lee via direct message on RocketChat.

Script can be found at /workspace/data_stats.py" was sent and is visible in the chat.
- **Verify Message Sender**: Verified. The `webpage accessibility tree` in Observation 09 shows `StaticText 'theagentcompany'` associated with the sent message, confirming the message was sent by the agent.
- **Verify Input Field Cleared**: Verified. The `textarea` (index 75) in `webpage interactive elements` from Observation 09 shows only placeholder text, and the `textbox 'Message'` in the `webpage accessibility tree` is empty, indicating that the message input field was cleared after sending.

Conclusion:
The Subtask "Send Script Location Message" is complete. The Task Agent successfully sent the specified message to Jessica Lee on RocketChat, as confirmed by the correct message content, proper sender attribution, and a cleared input field.

1. **Completeness Check**: Ensure every aspect of the requirements has been addressed. Confirm that no items were skipped, postponed, or only partially completed.  
2. **Consistency Check**: Verify that all intermediate results are logically coherent and data-wise consistent with the final conclusions. There should be no contradictions, missing steps, or unexplained gaps.  
3. **Final Completion Confirmation**:  
   - If any requirements remain unfinished or results are insufficient, explicitly list the next subtasks to resolve them.  
   - If all requirements are fully and correctly met, return an empty task plan to indicate the task is completely finished.  

Always remember that your ultimate goal is to complete task:
<task>
Check all the spreadsheet under the "Data Analysis" folder at http://the-agent-company.com:8092?dir=/Documents
Write a python program to calculate the average number of rows and columns for all the spreadsheet files. If a file has multiple sheets, count all the tables in all sheets. Save your python script to "/workspace/data_stats.py" as reference for the calculation process.

Then, inform Jessica Lee that you have finished the analysis. Send her the statistics in the format:
Average Rows: Average Number of Rows rounded of 2 decimal places
Average Columns: Average Number of Columns rounded of 2 decimal places

Also, send her a message on http://the-agent-company.com:3000/ saying "Analysis Finished. Script can be found at script_path" Replace script_path with the path of the data anlysis script.
