# ACTION #
During task execution, you can perform **Actions**, including:
1. **Tool Call**
2. **Python Code Execution**

## Action Output Format
1. **Tool Call**
When calling a tool, please output:
<tool_call>
{"name": "<function-name>", "arguments": <args-json-object>}
</tool_call>
- `<function-name>`: Tool function name
- `<args-json-object>`: Call arguments (JSON format)
- If multiple `<tool_call>` are output at once, only the first one will be executed; the rest will be ignored.

Available tool signatures are provided within the `<tools>` tag:
<tools>
{"type": "function", "function": {"name": "extract_image_content_by_gpt4o", "description": "Utilizes `gpt-4o` to interpret and extract content from local image files (e.g., PNG, JPEG). Highly effective for **scanned documents, image-based PDFs (post-conversion to image formats),** or visual data. For optimal extraction, craft precise queries. **Caution: While effective for general content, direct numerical or highly structured extraction from complex visual elements (e.g., tally marks, handwritten notes) may be imprecise; robust post-processing is often required. For multi-page documents, convert each page into a separate image and ensure *all* generated image pages are processed for complete data extraction.**", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"image_path": {"type": "string", "description": "Local image path."}, "query": {"type": "string", "description": "Query to the gpt-4o to get the image content."}}, "required": ["image_path", "query"]}}}

Element indices are dynamic and highly volatile; always verify the target element's existence and index using `browser_wait_and_get_update` immediately before clicking. Be aware that even with immediate updates, indices can shift in very dynamic UIs. Crucially, after clicking, always use `browser_wait_and_get_update` to immediately re-evaluate the page state and confirm the intended effect (e.g., UI changes, navigation). For navigation, `browser_go_to_url` is a more robust alternative when a direct URL is known. For form submissions or general action triggers, `browser_send_keys` with 'Enter' is often a more robust alternative, especially when direct clicking by index proves unreliable. Avoid clicking elements that are not currently visible or interactable.", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"index": {"type": "integer", "description": "The index number of the target element."}}, "required": ["index"]}}}

It cannot process content that is scrolled out of view or exists on other pages of a paginated list. While `accessibility tree` and `interactive elements` are primary for UI understanding, this visual tool can be a highly effective *primary* method for text extraction in challenging scenarios. **Crucially, for critical or structured data (e.g., IDs, specific names, numerical values), always cross-verify with or prefer extraction from the `webpage accessibility tree` as visual interpretation may introduce inaccuracies, especially for abbreviated or visually ambiguous elements.**", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"query": {"type": "string", "description": "Query to the VL model to get the browser page content."}}, "required": ["query"]}}}

The `webpage interactive elements` from its output are highly dynamic and should be used immediately. For verifying responses or dynamic updates, consider setting `seconds` to a value appropriate for expected latency (e.g., `seconds=1` for immediate state, longer for human-like response times). **This tool is a fundamental prerequisite for almost all subsequent browser interactions due to the highly dynamic nature of web UI element indices.**", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"seconds": {"type": "integer", "description": "The number of seconds to wait, the default is 3 seconds.", "default": 3}}, "required": []}}}

Returns a JSON object with `execution_status`, `returncode`, `stdout`, and `stderr`. **Important Precautions**: 1) `returncode=0` does not guarantee successful side effects (e.g., file creation); always verify with independent checks (`ls -l`, `file`). 2) **This tool executes commands in a *minimal* shell environment. Complex shell features like command chaining (`&&`, `||`), pipes (`|`), I/O redirection (`>`, `>>`), and backgrounding (`&`) are often *not reliably interpreted by `run_cmd` directly* and can lead to unexpected behavior or errors (e.g., `SyntaxError`, `command not found`). For any non-trivial shell interaction or complex logic, *always prefer consolidating operations into a single Python script that uses `subprocess` for explicit control and robustness* over multiple `run_cmd` calls or complex shell syntax.** 3) Quote arguments containing spaces (`\"path with spaces\"`). 4) State changes (`cd`) do not persist across calls.", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"command": {"type": "string", "description": "command暂时没有参数描述"}}, "required": ["command"]}}}
</tools>

2. **Python Code Execution**
When executing Python code, please output:
<code>
... your code ...
</code>
- The working directory is `/workspace`
- Executing dangerous, destructive, or time-consuming code is prohibited.
- If both a **Tool Call** and **Python Code Execution** are included in the output, the tool call takes precedence, and the Python code will not be executed.
- Using outdated or limited python libraries may result in incomplete or inaccurate observations (e.g. missing images from PDFs or failing to extract key content). Always prefer robust, modern libraries to ensure full and reliable results.
- When performing file conversion or data extraction, always ensure **data integrity**. Verify that the structure, content, and critical fields of the source file are preserved in the output. Check row and column counts, headers, and key values before and after processing. **Avoid silent loss**, truncation, or unintended alteration of data.

## Action Execution Result Processing
- After each action is executed, an Observation is returned, which includes:
    1. `<tool_response>`: The result of the tool or code execution.
    2. `<tool_instruction>`: The instruction associated with a specific action, used to guide the next step or restrict subsequent behavior.
- **Note**: Do not fabricate observations.

## Security and Restrictions
- **Coding Actions (such as Python, CMD, etc.)**
    - Do not run high-risk operations that are large in code size or take a long time.
    - Do not execute code that could cause data loss, system damage, or irreversible changes.
    - Do not use the kill command with wildcards like * or other dangerous parameters that could result in a wide range of matches.
    - Prefer using the Python interpreter to execute code (safer and more efficient) rather than using the CMD tool.

> ⚠️ **Important**
> When your output contains content that fully conforms to the **Tool Call** or **Python Code Execution** format, the system will immediately parse, identify, and execute it as an **Action** without further confirmation and without reversal.
> Therefore, before outputting, always confirm that this is your **intended** action and fully assess the potential consequences and risks.
> If you are only using **quotes, demonstrations, or examples**, be sure to break the formatting or escape it to prevent the system from interpreting it as a real action.

# OBJECTIVE #
Your core objective is to independently and efficiently complete the tasks assigned to you by the company.


# MEMORY #
During previous tasks, you have accumulated the following reusable knowledge:

## Resolution Patterns
Comprehensive Contextualization: Systematically acquire and aggregate information from diverse, potentially unstructured sources, prioritizing local processing and cross-validation, to ensure a complete, coherent operational view and inform robust decisions.
Robust External Interaction: Prioritize stable, predictable interaction methods, such as structured APIs, and dynamically adapt strategies to ensure continuity and reliability with external systems despite their inconsistencies or volatility.
Adaptive Constraint Handling: When an objective is blocked by an unresolvable external constraint, acknowledge the limitation, perform necessary cleanup of partial artifacts, and adapt the strategy to proceed with viable data, avoiding unproductive retries.
Modular Resilient Design: Decompose operations into modular, decoupled units with explicit state management, to enhance predictability, isolate errors, improve maintainability, and ensure operational continuity.
Progressive Verification: Implement multi-stage validation, from granular checks within pipelines to comprehensive outcome validation, to localize errors, confirm system states, and ensure successful execution.

## Platform/Application Operation Guides
These guides summarize proven operation paths derived from past successful experiences.  
Each item is a structured reference designed to help you complete operations more quickly, accurately, and with reduced redundancy.

> This directory provides a comprehensive index of guides, compiling best practices and experience summaries for accomplishing various tasks.

### Recommended Usage Process
1. **Review the Guide First**  
   Before starting a task, browse the relevant entries in the directory to identify potentially useful guidance.  
2. **Targeted Access**  
   Use the `access_the_application_guide` tool to view detailed steps if necessary.  
3. **Reuse with Flexibility**  
   Apply past successful steps when they fit the current situation, but stay aware of possible mismatches.  
4. **Explore When Deviations Arise**  
   If the environment or results diverge from the guide, stop rigidly following it and explore alternative approaches through small, safe, and adaptive steps.

### Value of Guides
- Reduce task completion time by leveraging accumulated experience.  
- Lower error rates and avoid common pitfalls.  
- Ensure consistent, professional execution of tasks.  

### Guide Reliability & Adaptation
- Guides may be outdated, biased, or contain errors — they are “historical experience,” not absolute truth.  
- Use guides as starting points, not as strict rules.  
- When deviations or conflicts appear, **exit the guide and explore new paths** instead of persisting.  
- Record useful deviation points for later improvement of the guides.

<tool_instruction>
If an `Element index does not exist` error is returned, it indicates extreme element volatility. **Always re-evaluate `webpage interactive elements` with `browser_wait_and_get_update` immediately before attempting a click, and crucially, confirm the element's `text` or `aria-label` attribute semantically matches the intended target.** If direct clicking by index proves unreliable, *especially within dynamic lists or sidebars (e.g., chat contact lists)*, consider alternative strategies like using an application's built-in search functionality or `browser_go_to_url` if a direct link is known, rather than repeatedly retrying. For form submissions or general action triggers, `browser_send_keys` with 'Enter' is a more robust alternative and **highly recommended for reliability**.

Title: Subtask Completion Report: Login to ownCloud

Checklist Details:
- **verify_url_after_login**: Passed. The browser's URL after the login action (Observation 11) is `http://the-agent-company.com:8092/index.php/apps/files/?dir=%2F&fileid=5`, which corresponds to the ownCloud file management interface, indicating successful navigation.
- **verify_absence_of_login_form**: Passed. A comparison of `webpage interactive elements` before (Observation 5) and after (Observation 11 and 13) login confirms that the username and password input fields, and the login button are no longer present on the page, signifying the login form's absence.
- **verify_user_is_logged_in**: Passed. The `webpage accessibility tree` and `webpage interactive elements` in Observation 11 and 13 clearly show the `StaticText 'theagentcompany'` and `div` elements containing "theagentcompany", confirming the user is successfully logged in and their username is displayed.

Conclusion:
All verification checks have passed. The Subtask "Login to ownCloud" is complete.

Replace `<username>`, `<password>`, `<webdav_url>`, and `<local_file_path>` with actual values.

Python libraries `xml.etree.ElementTree`, `json`, and `subprocess` are available.', 'steps': 'Create a self-contained Python script (e.g., `/workspace/webdav_full_discovery.py`) that encapsulates the entire WebDAV traversal logic. The script should:\n- Load/initialize state from `/workspace/webdav_state.json` (managing keys like `directories_to_visit`, `visited_directories`, `all_file_paths`).\n- Define connection details such as `OWNCLOUD_URL`, `WEBDAV_BASE_URL`, `USERNAME`, and `PASSWORD`.\n- Implement a function to parse PROPFIND XML responses, extracting new directory and file URLs, ensuring full URLs are constructed (`OWNCLOUD_URL + href_path`).\n- Implement a function using Python\'s `subprocess.run` to execute `curl PROPFIND` commands with `Depth: 1`, capturing stdout, stderr, and returncode.\n- Contain a main execution loop that iteratively:\n  - Pops a directory URL from `directories_to_visit`.\n  - Adds it to `visited_directories`.\n  - Calls the internal `curl PROPFIND` execution function for the current directory.\n  - Parses the `stdout` for new directories and files.\n  - Adds new, unvisited directory URLs to `directories_to_visit`.\n  - Adds all discovered file URLs to `all_file_paths`.\n  - Saves the updated state to `/workspace/webdav_state.json` after each iteration.\n  - Continues until `directories_to_visit` is empty or a predefined `max_iterations` limit is reached.\n- Prints a clear completion signal (e.g., `COMPLETE_WEBDAV_DISCOVERY:<json_list_of_all_file_paths>`) upon finishing the traversal.\n-> Execute the Python script: `run_cmd(command="python3 /workspace/webdav_full_discovery.py")`.\n-> Verify successful completion by checking the `stdout` of the `run_cmd` for the `COMPLETE_WEBDAV_DISCOVERY` signal and the presence of a populated `all_file_paths` list in `webdav_state.json`.', 'notes': 'This guide describes a robust, self-contained Python script for comprehensive breadth-first traversal of OwnCloud WebDAV. This approach avoids external passing of `tool_response` between discrete actions, which was a source of previous errors. State is persisted via `/workspace/webdav_state.json`, allowing for potential resumption (though for a fresh scan, any prior `webdav_state.json` should be removed). URLs for directories should consistently end with a slash (`/`). The script uses `subprocess.run` internally, so external `run_cmd` calls are not needed for each `PROPFIND` request during the traversal itself. A `max_iterations` limit serves as a safety mechanism to prevent infinite loops in large or cyclic directory structures.'}

25. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================
Thought: I have reviewed the OwnCloud guides for downloading files and systematically searching WebDAV. The "DownloadFile" guide requires a known WebDAV URL, which I don't have yet. The "SystematicWebDAVFileSearch" guide provides a method to discover files and their paths using a Python script for WebDAV traversal. This is the more appropriate approach to find `receipt.jpg` and `Reimbursement Policy.pdf` and obtain their WebDAV URLs. I will create a Python script to perform this search.

First, I need to write the Python script `webdav_full_discovery.py` as described in the guide.

Based on analyzing the current Subtask, its goal, and **your Subtask's execution trajectory**, the Check Agent reports that the current Subtask has failed to complete. The above is the Check Agent's check report.
Please combine this check report with the current Subtask's historical execution trajectory to analyze the key obstacles currently hindering task completion and develop an actionable plan for the next steps.


31. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================
* The current Subtask still has the following issues:
    1. The previous execution trajectory for "Download receipt.jpg" bypassed direct browser interaction with the OwnCloud GUI for file retrieval, instead using `wget`. This likely deviated from the expected method of demonstrating proficiency with OwnCloud's web interface as implied by available guides.
    2. I did not explicitly navigate through the OwnCloud directory structure (`/Documents/Financials`) using browser actions before attempting to download the file.

* Consider trying the following actions:
    1. Delete the currently downloaded `receipt.jpg` from `/workspace` to ensure a fresh download attempt via the browser.
    2. Access the `OwnCloud/NavigateDirectory` guide to learn the proper steps for navigating OwnCloud's file structure via the browser.
    3. Use browser interactions (clicks, perhaps inputting folder names if search is available) to navigate to the `/Documents/Financials` directory within the OwnCloud web interface.
    4. Once in the `/Documents/Financials` directory, access the `OwnCloud/DownloadFile` guide and carefully examine the interactive elements to identify and use the correct browser action (e.g., clicking a specific download button, using a context menu option) to download `receipt.jpg`.
    5. After attempting the browser-based download, verify the file's presence in `/workspace` using shell commands.

If an `Element index does not exist` error is returned, it indicates extreme element volatility. **Always re-evaluate `webpage interactive elements` with `browser_wait_and_get_update` immediately before attempting a click, and crucially, confirm the element's `text` or `aria-label` attribute semantically matches the intended target.** If direct clicking by index proves unreliable, *especially within dynamic lists or sidebars (e.g., chat contact lists)*, consider alternative strategies like using an application's built-in search functionality or `browser_go_to_url` if a direct link is known, rather than repeatedly retrying. For form submissions or general action triggers, `browser_send_keys` with 'Enter' is a more robust alternative and **highly recommended for reliability**.

Thought: I have successfully extracted the full text of the reimbursement policy and obtained detailed information about the receipt. The subtask is to "Extract reimbursement criteria from Reimbursement Policy.pdf". This means identifying the *relevant* criteria from the extracted text that apply to the receipt. The receipt is from a "Swanky Hotel Bar" and includes a subtotal and a tip. I need to find policy sections related to meals, entertainment, and tips.

From the extracted policy text, I can see the following relevant sections:

*   **6. Meal Allowances**
    *   6.1 Daily Meal Limits (Per Diem) - This seems to apply to individual meals during travel.
    *   6.2 Business Meals with Clients - This has a "Maximum per person: $100" and mentions "Alcohol limited to 2 drinks per person". This might be relevant if the bar expense is considered a business meal.
*   **7. Additional Expenses**
    *   7.3 Incidental Expenses - "Tips: Up to 20% for services". This is directly relevant to the tip amount.
*   **9. Non-Reimbursable Expenses**
    *   "Minibar charges" and "Personal entertainment" are listed as non-reimbursable. I need to consider if "hotel bar" falls under "personal entertainment" or if it's a business meal. Given the context of a "hotel bar", it could be either. However, the policy explicitly lists "Business Meals with Clients" with a per-person limit and alcohol limits. If it's not a business meal, it might be considered personal entertainment.

Given that the receipt does not list specific items and is from a "hotel bar", it's ambiguous whether it's a business meal or personal entertainment. However, the task implies that *some* reimbursement is possible. I will assume it falls under "Business Meals with Clients" as the most likely category for a bar expense that could be reimbursed, and apply the tip policy separately.

Reimbursement criteria extracted:
1.  **Business Meals with Clients**: Maximum per person: $100. Alcohol limited to 2 drinks per person. (Since no attendees are mentioned and no specific items, I will assume it's a single person's expense, and the $100 limit applies to the subtotal of $179.19).
2.  **Tips**: Up to 20% for services.

Therefore, the relevant criteria are:
-   For the meal/bar subtotal: Max $100 per person for business meals.
-   For tips: Up to 20% of the service amount.

I have extracted the relevant criteria from the PDF.
Final Answer: The relevant reimbursement criteria extracted from "Reimbursement Policy.pdf" are:
1.  **Business Meals with Clients**: Maximum per person: $100.
2.  **Tips**: Up to 20% for services.
The receipt is from a "Swanky Hotel Bar" with a subtotal of $179.19 and a tip of $44.80.

Title: Subtask Completion Report: Extract reimbursement criteria from Reimbursement Policy.pdf

Checklist Details:
- **verify_extracted_text_file_existence**: Passed. The `ls` command confirmed the existence of `/workspace/reimbursement_policy_text.txt` with `returncode: 0`, as shown in the tool response for CheckStep 1. This verifies that the text extraction process successfully created the output file.
- **verify_extracted_text_content**: Passed. The content of `/workspace/reimbursement_policy_text.txt`, obtained via the `cat` command in CheckStep 2, was compared with the Task Agent's `stdout` in Observation 13. Both contents were identical, confirming that the PDF text was fully and accurately extracted into the file.
- **verify_relevance_of_extracted_criteria**: Passed. An independent review of the reimbursement policy text (Task Agent's Observation 13) and the detailed receipt information (Task Agent's Observation 15) confirmed that the criteria identified by the Task Agent ("Business Meals with Clients: Maximum per person: $100" and "Tips: Up to 20% for services") are indeed the most relevant for the "Swanky Hotel Bar" receipt. The Task Agent's consideration of potential ambiguity (e.g., personal entertainment vs. business meal) and subsequent decision to apply the business meal criteria for the purpose of finding a reimbursable amount was deemed reasonable and aligned with the task's objective. No critical, more relevant criteria were overlooked or misinterpreted.

Conclusion:
All verification checks have passed. The Subtask "Extract reimbursement criteria from Reimbursement Policy.pdf" is complete.

SubTask6: Calculate reimbursable price
Goal: The final reimbursable price is calculated based on the extracted receipt price and reimbursement policy.
89. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================
Thought: I have all the necessary information to calculate the reimbursable price. I will perform the calculation using Python directly, as no specific guide is needed for this arithmetic.

Here's the plan:
1.  Define the extracted values: `subtotal = 179.19`, `tip = 44.80`.
2.  Define the policy limits: `max_meal_reimbursement = 100`, `max_tip_percentage = 0.20`.
3.  Calculate the reimbursable subtotal: `min(subtotal, max_meal_reimbursement)`.
4.  Calculate the maximum allowable tip based on the original subtotal: `subtotal * max_tip_percentage`.
5.  Calculate the reimbursable tip: `min(tip, max_allowable_tip)`.
6.  Calculate the total reimbursable amount: `reimbursable_subtotal + reimbursable_tip`.

I will use a Python script for this.

Title: Subtask Completion Report: Calculate reimbursable price

Checklist Details:
- **verify_calculation_accuracy**: Passed. The re-execution of the Task Agent's Python script, as shown in the tool response for CheckStep 1, yielded `Reimbursable Subtotal: 100.00`, `Reimbursable Tip: 35.84`, and `Total Reimbursable Amount: 135.84`. These results are identical to the `stdout` reported in the Task Agent's Observation 3, confirming the arithmetic accuracy of the calculation.
- **verify_final_answer_consistency**: Passed. The Task Agent's "Final Answer: The final reimbursable price is 135.84" from Observation 4 directly matches the "Total Reimbursable Amount: 135.84" derived from the Python script's `stdout` in Observation 3.

Title: Subtask Completion Report: Login to RocketChat

Checklist Details:
- **verify_url_after_login**: Passed. The browser's URL after the login action (Observation 11) is `http://the-agent-company.com:3000/home`. This URL is the expected RocketChat home page, confirming successful navigation away from the login page.
- **verify_absence_of_login_form**: Passed. The `webpage interactive elements` in Observation 11, after the login attempt, no longer show the input fields with `placeholder="Email or username"` (index 6) or `placeholder="Password"` (index 8), nor the `Login` button (index 9) that were present in Observation 5 (before login). This indicates that the login form elements are absent from the page.
- **verify_presence_of_dashboard_elements**: Passed. The `webpage accessibility tree` in Observation 11 clearly shows elements indicative of a successful RocketChat dashboard, such as `button 'Home'`, `button 'Search'`, `button 'Directory'`, and `link 'general'`, as well as a list of channels and direct messages (e.g., `link 'mike_chen'`). These elements confirm that the user is logged in and viewing the main RocketChat interface.

If an `Element index does not exist` error is returned, it indicates extreme element volatility. **Always re-evaluate `webpage interactive elements` with `browser_wait_and_get_update` immediately before attempting a click, and crucially, confirm the element's `text` or `aria-label` attribute semantically matches the intended target.** If direct clicking by index proves unreliable, *especially within dynamic lists or sidebars (e.g., chat contact lists)*, consider alternative strategies like using an application's built-in search functionality or `browser_go_to_url` if a direct link is known, rather than repeatedly retrying. For form submissions or general action triggers, `browser_send_keys` with 'Enter' is a more robust alternative and **highly recommended for reliability**.

If not already in the target channel or direct message, use `RocketChat: AccessConversation` or `Browser: NavigateToURL` (if the exact channel/DM URL is known, e.g., `http://the-agent-company.com:3000/channel/literaturereview`) to navigate there first. If an obstructing sidebar (e.g., channel details) is open, it may need to be closed first (e.g., via `Browser: DismissOverlay`). Replace `<message_content>` with the actual message. Successful sending verified by observing `webpage accessibility tree` for the presence of a `paragraph` element containing the message content, typically preceded by `StaticText` for the sender username (e.g., `StaticText 'theagentcompany'`) and a timestamp (e.g., `StaticText '10:28 PM'`). The message input field should also appear cleared after successful sending. For replies, allow additional time for `browser_wait_and_get_update()` (e.g., 5-10 seconds) then analyze `webpage accessibility tree`."}

Title: Subtask Completion Report: Inform Mike Chen of the reimbursable price

Checklist Details:
- **verify_message_sent_to_mike_chen**: Passed. The `webpage accessibility tree` in Observation 07 clearly shows a `paragraph` element containing `StaticText 'The reimbursable price for the receipt is $135.84.'`, confirming the message was successfully posted in the chat with Mike Chen.
- **verify_message_input_field_cleared**: Passed. The `webpage accessibility tree` in Observation 07 for the `textbox 'Message'` shows `generic '', editable='plaintext'` and the `webpage interactive elements` show the `textarea` (index 30) with an empty `text` attribute. This indicates that the message input field was cleared after sending, which aligns with successful message processing. This contrasts with Observation 05 where the text was present in the input field.
