Returns a JSON object with `execution_status`, `returncode`, `stdout`, and `stderr`. **Important Precautions**: 1) `returncode=0` does not guarantee successful side effects (e.g., file creation); always verify with independent checks (`ls -l`, `file`). 2) **This tool executes commands in a *minimal* shell environment. Complex shell features like command chaining (`&&`, `||`), pipes (`|`), I/O redirection (`>`, `>>`), and backgrounding (`&`) are often *not reliably interpreted by `run_cmd` directly* and can lead to unexpected behavior or errors (e.g., `SyntaxError`, `command not found`). For any non-trivial shell interaction or complex logic, *always prefer consolidating operations into a single Python script that uses `subprocess` for explicit control and robustness* over multiple `run_cmd` calls or complex shell syntax.** 3) Quote arguments containing spaces (`\"path with spaces\"`). 4) State changes (`cd`) do not persist across calls.", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"command": {"type": "string", "description": "command暂时没有参数描述"}}, "required": ["command"]}}}
</tools>

2. **Python Code Execution**
When executing Python code, please output:
<code>
... your code ...
</code>
- The working directory is `/workspace`
- Executing dangerous, destructive, or time-consuming code is prohibited.
- If both a **Tool Call** and **Python Code Execution** are included in the output, the tool call takes precedence, and the Python code will not be executed.
- Using outdated or limited python libraries may result in incomplete or inaccurate observations (e.g. missing images from PDFs or failing to extract key content). Always prefer robust, modern libraries to ensure full and reliable results.
- When performing file conversion or data extraction, always ensure **data integrity**. Verify that the structure, content, and critical fields of the source file are preserved in the output. Check row and column counts, headers, and key values before and after processing. **Avoid silent loss**, truncation, or unintended alteration of data.

## Action Execution Result Processing
- After each action is executed, an Observation is returned, which includes:
    1. `<tool_response>`: The result of the tool or code execution.
    2. `<tool_instruction>`: The instruction associated with a specific action, used to guide the next step or restrict subsequent behavior.
- **Note**: Do not fabricate observations.

## Security and Restrictions
- **Coding Actions (such as Python, CMD, etc.)**
    - Do not run high-risk operations that are large in code size or take a long time.
    - Do not execute code that could cause data loss, system damage, or irreversible changes.
    - Do not use the kill command with wildcards like * or other dangerous parameters that could result in a wide range of matches.
    - Prefer using the Python interpreter to execute code (safer and more efficient) rather than using the CMD tool.

> ⚠️ **Important**
> When your output contains content that fully conforms to the **Tool Call** or **Python Code Execution** format, the system will immediately parse, identify, and execute it as an **Action** without further confirmation and without reversal.
> Therefore, before outputting, always confirm that this is your **intended** action and fully assess the potential consequences and risks.
> If you are only using **quotes, demonstrations, or examples**, be sure to break the formatting or escape it to prevent the system from interpreting it as a real action.

# OBJECTIVE #
Your core objective is to independently and efficiently complete the tasks assigned to you by the company.


# MEMORY #
During previous tasks, you have accumulated the following reusable knowledge:

## Resolution Patterns
Comprehensive Contextualization: Systematically acquire and aggregate information from diverse, potentially unstructured sources, prioritizing local processing and cross-validation, to ensure a complete, coherent operational view and inform robust decisions.
Robust External Interaction: Prioritize stable, predictable interaction methods, such as structured APIs, and dynamically adapt strategies to ensure continuity and reliability with external systems despite their inconsistencies or volatility.
Adaptive Constraint Handling: When an objective is blocked by an unresolvable external constraint, acknowledge the limitation, perform necessary cleanup of partial artifacts, and adapt the strategy to proceed with viable data, avoiding unproductive retries.
Modular Resilient Design: Decompose operations into modular, decoupled units with explicit state management, to enhance predictability, isolate errors, improve maintainability, and ensure operational continuity.
Progressive Verification: Implement multi-stage validation, from granular checks within pipelines to comprehensive outcome validation, to localize errors, confirm system states, and ensure successful execution.

## Platform/Application Operation Guides
These guides summarize proven operation paths derived from past successful experiences.  
Each item is a structured reference designed to help you complete operations more quickly, accurately, and with reduced redundancy.

> This directory provides a comprehensive index of guides, compiling best practices and experience summaries for accomplishing various tasks.

### Recommended Usage Process
1. **Review the Guide First**  
   Before starting a task, browse the relevant entries in the directory to identify potentially useful guidance.  
2. **Targeted Access**  
   Use the `access_the_application_guide` tool to view detailed steps if necessary.  
3. **Reuse with Flexibility**  
   Apply past successful steps when they fit the current situation, but stay aware of possible mismatches.  
4. **Explore When Deviations Arise**  
   If the environment or results diverge from the guide, stop rigidly following it and explore alternative approaches through small, safe, and adaptive steps.

### Value of Guides
- Reduce task completion time by leveraging accumulated experience.  
- Lower error rates and avoid common pitfalls.  
- Ensure consistent, professional execution of tasks.  

### Guide Reliability & Adaptation
- Guides may be outdated, biased, or contain errors — they are “historical experience,” not absolute truth.  
- Use guides as starting points, not as strict rules.  
- When deviations or conflicts appear, **exit the guide and explore new paths** instead of persisting.  
- Record useful deviation points for later improvement of the guides.

Carefully review the updated context and determine how this new knowledge impacts the overall task progress.  
Design the next subtask to effectively leverage these insights and move closer to completing the full task.

Always remember that your ultimate goal is to complete task:
<task>
You need to release a new version of RisingWave in gitlab. You can access it at http://the-agent-company.com:8929/root/risingwave/ The release title must be release-2024-10-12, and the release tag name can be whatever you want. You don’t need to upload any binary file.

The release notes must be the following verbatim:

SubTask5: Fill Release Form
Goal: The release title, tag name, and release notes are successfully entered into the respective fields in the release creation form.
53. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================
Thought: The current subtask is to fill the release form. This involves entering text into several fields: "Tag name", "Release title", and "Release notes". I will need to use `browser_input_text` for these fields. I should also ensure that the page is updated before attempting to input text.

Relevant `Platform/Application Operation Guide Directory` entries:
- Browser: `WaitForPageUpdate`

I will access the `WaitForPageUpdate` guide.
Action:
<tool_call>
{"name": "access_the_application_guide", "arguments": {"application_name": "Browser", "item_names": ["WaitForPageUpdate"]}}

Thought: I have accessed the `WaitForPageUpdate` guide, which confirms its purpose. Now I need to fill the "Tag name", "Release title", and "Release notes" fields. I will use `browser_input_text` for each field, ensuring to update the browser state with `browser_wait_and_get_update` before each input to get the most current indices.

First, I will input the "Tag name" with "release-2024-10-12" into index 64.

After inputting text, always use `browser_wait_and_get_update` to verify the text input, check for immediate validation feedback, or confirm any UI changes (e.g., enable/disable buttons, form submission readiness). Be especially mindful of index volatility, as UI changes can rapidly invalidate previously retrieved indices.

57. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================
Thought: The previous attempt to input text into index 64 for "Tag name" failed. Upon re-examining the `webpage interactive elements` and `webpage accessibility tree`, it appears that the "Tag name (required)" is associated with a `button` at index 62, not a direct input field. It's possible that clicking this button will reveal an input field or allow direct input. I will click the button at index 62, then wait for the page to update and re-evaluate the interactive elements to find the correct input field for the tag name.

For form submissions or general action triggers, `browser_send_keys` with 'Enter' is a more robust alternative and **highly recommended for reliability**.

This indicates that the form was not submitted. The previous attempts to click the "Create release" button by index also failed. The `tool_instruction` emphasizes re-evaluating interactive elements.

After reviewing the `webpage interactive elements` from the last observation, the "Create release" button is still present with index 99. Since direct clicking by index has been unreliable, and sending 'Enter' keys didn't work, I will try to click the button again with the current index 99. If this fails again, I will consider using a visual approach to confirm the button's presence and then try to click it.

</tool_instruction>

91. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================
Thought: The previous attempts to submit the form have failed, both by clicking the button and by sending the 'Enter' key. The `tool_instruction` consistently advises re-evaluating the interactive elements. The `webpage interactive elements` show that the "Create release" button is still present at index 99. Given the repeated failures with `browser_click` on this specific index and the ineffectiveness of `browser_send_keys` (which should typically submit a form), there might be a deeper issue with the element's interactability or a modal/overlay preventing interaction.

Since the goal is to submit the release, and I have already filled all the necessary fields, I will try to directly navigate to the releases page. If the release was indeed created (meaning the form submission happened in the background or with a delayed effect), navigating to the releases page should show the new release. This acts as a verification step and a way to move past the problematic form submission UI. If the release is not there, I will have to re-evaluate the form submission process.

The URL for the releases page is `http://the-agent-company.com:8929/root/risingwave/-/releases`.

Thought: I have navigated back to the Releases page. I need to check if the new release `release-2024-10-12` is present on this page. If it is, then the release was successfully created, and this subtask is complete.

Looking at the `webpage accessibility tree`, I can see several releases listed, such as 'v2.0.2', 'v2.0.1', 'v1.10.2', etc. I need to specifically look for 'release-2024-10-12'. I will use `browser_extract_content_by_vision` to search for the release title on the page, as it is more robust for checking content presence than parsing the accessibility tree directly for a specific string.

Thought: The direct UI interaction for submitting the release form has proven unreliable. I have tried clicking the "Create release" button by index multiple times, and sending 'Enter' keys, but the form is not submitting. The `tool_instruction` emphasizes re-evaluating interactive elements but doesn't offer a solution for persistent click failures. Given that the task is to create a release in GitLab, and I have already filled in all the required information, I will now investigate if GitLab provides an API for creating releases. This would be a more robust and reliable method. I will check the GitLab guides for any API-related entries.

Thought: The direct clicking of the "Create release" button by index has failed repeatedly, and sending "Enter" keys also didn't work. This suggests a highly dynamic UI where element indices are unreliable. The `tool_instruction` advises re-evaluating interactive elements. I will use `browser_wait_and_get_update` to get the absolute latest interactive elements and then attempt to click the "Create release" button with its newly identified index. If this fails again, I will need to consider a different strategy, potentially involving a visual click or a more robust form submission method if available.

Thought: The previous attempts to click the "Create release" button at index 100 failed. The `tool_instruction` emphasizes re-evaluating interactive elements. I have done this, and the button is still present with the same text. The persistent failure to click by index, even after re-evaluation, suggests that the element might not be directly clickable by its accessibility tree index, or there's an overlay preventing interaction.

I will try to click the button at index 100 one more time. If it fails, I will use `browser_extract_content_by_vision` to confirm the button's visual presence and then re-evaluate the next steps.

Thought: The previous attempts to click the "Create release" button by index and to submit the form using 'Enter' key have repeatedly failed. The `tool_instruction` consistently advises re-evaluating interactive elements due to volatility. I have done this, and the button still appears in the `webpage interactive elements` but is not clickable by its index.

Since direct interaction methods are proving unreliable, I will use `browser_extract_content_by_vision` to visually confirm the presence and location of the "Create release" button. This will help determine if the button is actually visible and interactive on the page, or if there's a visual overlay or other issue preventing interaction. If it is visually present, and I still cannot click it, I will need to consider alternative, more advanced interaction methods or report this as a potential blocker.

Title: Subtask Completion Verification Report: Submit Release

Checklist Details:
- **Check 1: Verify release existence on GitLab Releases page**
    - Goal: Confirm whether the release with the title 'release-2024-10-12' has been successfully created and is visible on the GitLab releases page.
    - Observation: In step 22 of the Task Agent's trajectory, the `browser_extract_content_by_vision` tool was used with the query "Is 'release-2024-10-12' visible on this page?". The `tool_response` in step 23 explicitly states: "No, 'release-2024-10-12' is not visible on this page."
    - Result: FAILED. The desired release was not found on the releases page.

Conclusion:
The Subtask "Submit Release" is not complete. Despite attempts to submit the release form, the new release 'release-2024-10-12' was not found on the GitLab releases page. The Task Agent needs to re-attempt the submission process and verify its success.
</check_report>

Based on analyzing the current Subtask, its goal, and **your Subtask's execution trajectory**, the Check Agent reports that the current Subtask has failed to complete. The above is the Check Agent's check report.
Please combine this check report with the current Subtask's historical execution trajectory to analyze the key obstacles currently hindering task completion and develop an actionable plan for the next steps.


115. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================
* The current Subtask still has the following issues:
    1. The "Create release" button was not clicked after filling out the release form, leading to the release not being submitted.

* Consider trying the following actions:
    1. Identify and click the "Create release" button on the current page to submit the release form.
    2. After clicking, verify the page has updated and the new release is visible.

SubTask6: Submit Release
Goal: The new release is successfully created and published.
The goal of this subtask has not been achieved yet, please continue
117. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================
Thought: The subtask to "Submit Release" has repeatedly failed due to an inability to interact with the "Create release" button through direct UI interaction. I need to switch to a more robust method, which is using the GitLab API. To use the API, I first need to generate a Personal Access Token. I will follow the steps outlined in the `GeneratePersonalAccessToken` guide.

First, I need to go to the "Access Personal Access Tokens Page" which is a prerequisite for generating a token.

Thought: I have navigated to the Personal Access Tokens page and clicked "Add new token". Now I need to fill in the details for the new token.

First, I need to enter a name for the token. Based on the `webpage interactive elements` from the last observation, the input field for 'Token name' is at index 57. I will use "release_automation_token" as the token name.

Second, I need to select the scope. For creating releases via API, typically the `api` scope is necessary. In the last observation's interactive elements, I see `label 'api'` at index 63. I will click on this label, assuming it toggles the associated checkbox.

Finally, I need to submit the form to create the token. The guide suggests using `browser_send_keys(keys="Enter")` for robust submission. I will also look for a "Create personal access token" button if `Enter` doesn't work. The interactive elements show `button 'Create personal access token'` as the last interactive element within this form.

Thought: The previous attempts to click the "Create personal access token" button using a direct index or sending 'Enter' keys have been unsuccessful, consistently returning "Element index does not exist." This indicates an issue with dynamic element indexing or potentially the visibility of the element on the page.

Looking at the latest `webpage interactive elements`, I can find "Create personal access token" with index 82. I will try to click this element. It's possible the index changes quickly, and waiting for an update immediately before clicking might solve it. However, I have already been following this pattern. Given that the visual extraction previously indicated that parts of the page were cut off, I will try scrolling down again before attempting the click. This might ensure the button is within the viewport and hence correctly indexed and clickable.

If this click fails again, I'll re-evaluate the overall strategy for obtaining a Personal Access Token, possibly searching for a guide on API-based token creation, as UI interaction seems very fragile in this environment.

I see a button at index 58, "Click to hide", which implies the token is currently revealed. I will extract the token from the textbox associated with "Your new personal access token". Based on the accessibility tree, the textbox at `StaticText 'glpat-W2Vv3U3EfK2yJvWbVVGK'` is where the token is displayed. I will extract this value.

Thought: I have successfully extracted the Personal Access Token: `glpat-W2Vv3U3EfK2yJvWbVVGK`. This token will be used to interact with the GitLab API to create the release. This completes the sub-step of acquiring the necessary authentication for API interaction. Now I need to proceed with creating the release using this token.

Since I have the API token, I can use the `curl` command with `run_cmd` to interact with the GitLab API. I need to construct the `curl` command to create a new release for the RisingWave project with the specified title, tag, and release notes.

GitLab API documentation for creating a release: `POST /projects/:id/releases`
URL: `http://the-agent-company.com:8929/api/v4/projects/root%2Frisingwave/releases`
(Note: project path needs to be URL-encoded, `root/risingwave` becomes `root%2Frisingwave`).

Required parameters:
- `id`: project ID or URL-encoded path. (I will use `root%2Frisingwave`)
- `tag_name`: `release-2024-10-12`
- `name`: `release-2024-10-12` (the task specifies this as the release title)
- `description`: The verbatim release notes provided.
- `PRIVATE-TOKEN`: The Personal Access Token I just generated.

I will execute a `curl` command using `run_cmd` to create the release.

Title: Subtask Completion Verification Report: Submit Release

Checklist Details:
- **Check 1: Verify release existence on GitLab Releases page**
    - Goal: Confirm whether the release with the title 'release-2024-10-12' has been successfully created and is visible on the GitLab releases page.
    - Observation: In step 1 of the verification process, navigating to the releases page (`http://the-agent-company.com:8929/root/risingwave/-/releases`) confirmed the page loaded. Subsequent analysis of the `webpage accessibility tree` in step 1 of the verification process clearly showed a `heading 'release-2024-10-12'` and a `link 'release-2024-10-12'`, indicating the release is present.
    - Result: PASSED. The release 'release-2024-10-12' is visible on the GitLab releases page.

- **Check 2: Verify release details (title and release notes) integrity**
    - Goal: Extract the title and release notes of the 'release-2024-10-12' release from the GitLab releases page and compare them against the expected values to ensure content integrity and accuracy.
    - Observation: In step 2 of the verification process, `browser_extract_content_by_vision` was used with the query "Extract the release notes for 'release-2024-10-12' from the page." The `tool_response` in step 3 provided the following content: "sql feature Query syntax: Public preview: Supports AS CHANGELOG to convert any stream into an append-only changelog. SQL commands: Breaking change: DECLARE cursor_name SUBSCRIPTION CURSOR is the same as DECLARE cursor_name SUBSCRIPTION CURSOR since now(), which will be consumed from the current time. DECLARE cursor_name SUBSCRIPTION CURSOR FULL will start consuming data from stock. The type of operation has changed to varchar. It is one of Insert, Delete, UpdateInset, or UpdateDelete." This verbatim matches the expected release notes from the task description. The title "release-2024-10-12" was also confirmed present on the page in Check 1.
    - Result: PASSED. The extracted release title and notes match the expected content, confirming data integrity and accuracy.

Conclusion:
The Subtask "Submit Release" is complete. The new release with the title 'release-2024-10-12' and the specified release notes has been successfully created and published on the GitLab instance, as verified by direct observation on the releases page and extraction of its content.

Thought: I have accessed the guides. Now I need to navigate to the releases page to verify the release. I will use `browser_go_to_url` to go to the releases page.
Action:
<tool_call>
{"name": "browser_go_to_url", "arguments": {"url": "http://the-agent-company.com:8929/root/risingwave/-/releases"}}

Observation: 
<tool_response>
Performed browser action: 🔗 Navigated to http://the-agent-company.com:8929/root/risingwave/-/releases
The updated browser page status is as follows:
<webpage accessibility tree>[SYSTEM INFO: History accessibility tree removed for brevity]</webpage accessibility tree>
<webpage interactive elements>[SYSTEM INFO: History interactive elements removed for brevity]</webpage interactive elements>

</tool_response>
<tool_instruction>
Always inspect the `webpage accessibility tree` and `webpage interactive elements` after navigation to confirm the page loaded as expected. This step is crucial for verifying successful navigation and for preparing for subsequent interactions by ensuring the browser state is as anticipated.
