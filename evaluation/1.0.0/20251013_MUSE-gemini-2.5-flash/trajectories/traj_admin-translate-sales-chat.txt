# ACTION #
During task execution, you can perform **Actions**, including:
1. **Tool Call**
2. **Python Code Execution**

## Action Output Format
1. **Tool Call**
When calling a tool, please output:
<tool_call>
{"name": "<function-name>", "arguments": <args-json-object>}
</tool_call>
- `<function-name>`: Tool function name
- `<args-json-object>`: Call arguments (JSON format)
- If multiple `<tool_call>` are output at once, only the first one will be executed; the rest will be ignored.

Available tool signatures are provided within the `<tools>` tag:
<tools>
{"type": "function", "function": {"name": "extract_image_content_by_gpt4o", "description": "Utilizes `gpt-4o` to interpret and extract content from local image files (e.g., PNG, JPEG). Highly effective for **scanned documents, image-based PDFs (post-conversion to image formats),** or visual data. For optimal extraction, craft precise queries. **Caution: While effective for general content, direct numerical or highly structured extraction from complex visual elements (e.g., tally marks, handwritten notes) may be imprecise; robust post-processing is often required. For multi-page documents, convert each page into a separate image and ensure *all* generated image pages are processed for complete data extraction.**", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"image_path": {"type": "string", "description": "Local image path."}, "query": {"type": "string", "description": "Query to the gpt-4o to get the image content."}}, "required": ["image_path", "query"]}}}

Element indices are dynamic and highly volatile; always verify the target element's existence and index using `browser_wait_and_get_update` immediately before clicking. Be aware that even with immediate updates, indices can shift in very dynamic UIs. Crucially, after clicking, always use `browser_wait_and_get_update` to immediately re-evaluate the page state and confirm the intended effect (e.g., UI changes, navigation). For navigation, `browser_go_to_url` is a more robust alternative when a direct URL is known. For form submissions or general action triggers, `browser_send_keys` with 'Enter' is often a more robust alternative, especially when direct clicking by index proves unreliable. Avoid clicking elements that are not currently visible or interactable.", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"index": {"type": "integer", "description": "The index number of the target element."}}, "required": ["index"]}}}

It cannot process content that is scrolled out of view or exists on other pages of a paginated list. While `accessibility tree` and `interactive elements` are primary for UI understanding, this visual tool can be a highly effective *primary* method for text extraction in challenging scenarios. **Crucially, for critical or structured data (e.g., IDs, specific names, numerical values), always cross-verify with or prefer extraction from the `webpage accessibility tree` as visual interpretation may introduce inaccuracies, especially for abbreviated or visually ambiguous elements.**", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"query": {"type": "string", "description": "Query to the VL model to get the browser page content."}}, "required": ["query"]}}}

Complex shell features like command chaining (`&&`, `||`), pipes (`|`), I/O redirection (`>`, `>>`), and backgrounding (`&`) are often *not reliably interpreted by `run_cmd` directly* and can lead to unexpected behavior or errors (e.g., `SyntaxError`, `command not found`). For any non-trivial shell interaction or complex logic, *always prefer consolidating operations into a single Python script that uses `subprocess` for explicit control and robustness* over multiple `run_cmd` calls or complex shell syntax.** 3) Quote arguments containing spaces (`\"path with spaces\"`). 4) State changes (`cd`) do not persist across calls.", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"command": {"type": "string", "description": "command暂时没有参数描述"}}, "required": ["command"]}}}
</tools>

2. **Python Code Execution**
When executing Python code, please output:
<code>
... your code ...
</code>
- The working directory is `/workspace`
- Executing dangerous, destructive, or time-consuming code is prohibited.
- If both a **Tool Call** and **Python Code Execution** are included in the output, the tool call takes precedence, and the Python code will not be executed.
- Using outdated or limited python libraries may result in incomplete or inaccurate observations (e.g. missing images from PDFs or failing to extract key content). Always prefer robust, modern libraries to ensure full and reliable results.
- When performing file conversion or data extraction, always ensure **data integrity**. Verify that the structure, content, and critical fields of the source file are preserved in the output. Check row and column counts, headers, and key values before and after processing. **Avoid silent loss**, truncation, or unintended alteration of data.

## Action Execution Result Processing
- After each action is executed, an Observation is returned, which includes:
    1. `<tool_response>`: The result of the tool or code execution.
    2. `<tool_instruction>`: The instruction associated with a specific action, used to guide the next step or restrict subsequent behavior.
- **Note**: Do not fabricate observations.

## Security and Restrictions
- **Coding Actions (such as Python, CMD, etc.)**
    - Do not run high-risk operations that are large in code size or take a long time.
    - Do not execute code that could cause data loss, system damage, or irreversible changes.
    - Do not use the kill command with wildcards like * or other dangerous parameters that could result in a wide range of matches.
    - Prefer using the Python interpreter to execute code (safer and more efficient) rather than using the CMD tool.

> ⚠️ **Important**
> When your output contains content that fully conforms to the **Tool Call** or **Python Code Execution** format, the system will immediately parse, identify, and execute it as an **Action** without further confirmation and without reversal.
> Therefore, before outputting, always confirm that this is your **intended** action and fully assess the potential consequences and risks.
> If you are only using **quotes, demonstrations, or examples**, be sure to break the formatting or escape it to prevent the system from interpreting it as a real action.

# OBJECTIVE #
Your core objective is to independently and efficiently complete the tasks assigned to you by the company.


# MEMORY #
During previous tasks, you have accumulated the following reusable knowledge:

## Resolution Patterns
Comprehensive Contextualization: Systematically acquire and aggregate information from diverse, potentially unstructured sources, prioritizing local processing and cross-validation, to ensure a complete, coherent operational view and inform robust decisions.
Robust External Interaction: Prioritize stable, predictable interaction methods, such as structured APIs, and dynamically adapt strategies to ensure continuity and reliability with external systems despite their inconsistencies or volatility.
Adaptive Constraint Handling: When an objective is blocked by an unresolvable external constraint, acknowledge the limitation, perform necessary cleanup of partial artifacts, and adapt the strategy to proceed with viable data, avoiding unproductive retries.
Modular Resilient Design: Decompose operations into modular, decoupled units with explicit state management, to enhance predictability, isolate errors, improve maintainability, and ensure operational continuity.
Progressive Verification: Implement multi-stage validation, from granular checks within pipelines to comprehensive outcome validation, to localize errors, confirm system states, and ensure successful execution.

## Platform/Application Operation Guides
These guides summarize proven operation paths derived from past successful experiences.  
Each item is a structured reference designed to help you complete operations more quickly, accurately, and with reduced redundancy.

> This directory provides a comprehensive index of guides, compiling best practices and experience summaries for accomplishing various tasks.

### Recommended Usage Process
1. **Review the Guide First**  
   Before starting a task, browse the relevant entries in the directory to identify potentially useful guidance.  
2. **Targeted Access**  
   Use the `access_the_application_guide` tool to view detailed steps if necessary.  
3. **Reuse with Flexibility**  
   Apply past successful steps when they fit the current situation, but stay aware of possible mismatches.  
4. **Explore When Deviations Arise**  
   If the environment or results diverge from the guide, stop rigidly following it and explore alternative approaches through small, safe, and adaptive steps.

### Value of Guides
- Reduce task completion time by leveraging accumulated experience.  
- Lower error rates and avoid common pitfalls.  
- Ensure consistent, professional execution of tasks.  

### Guide Reliability & Adaptation
- Guides may be outdated, biased, or contain errors — they are “historical experience,” not absolute truth.  
- Use guides as starting points, not as strict rules.  
- When deviations or conflicts appear, **exit the guide and explore new paths** instead of persisting.  
- Record useful deviation points for later improvement of the guides.

Thought: The `browser_click` action timed out. This doesn't necessarily mean the login failed, but it indicates an issue with the browser interaction. The guide mentions that a `TimeoutError` during `browser_click` on the login button does not necessarily mean failure and suggests verifying successful login by checking for a URL change or the appearance of file management elements. I should use `browser_wait_and_get_update()` to check the current state of the page and verify if the login was successful.
Action:
<tool_call>
{"name": "browser_wait_and_get_update", "arguments": {"seconds": 3}}

Observation: 
<tool_response>
Performed browser action: 🕒  Waiting for 3 seconds
The updated browser page status is as follows:
<webpage accessibility tree>[SYSTEM INFO: History accessibility tree removed for brevity]</webpage accessibility tree>
<webpage interactive elements>[SYSTEM INFO: History interactive elements removed for brevity]</webpage interactive elements>

</tool_response>
<tool_instruction>
If a `TimeoutError` occurs, the browser was unresponsive; consider `browser_go_to_url` to reset state. *Crucially, after waiting, always thoroughly analyze the updated `webpage accessibility tree` for the *presence* of expected content or changes (e.g., new chat messages, confirmation dialogs), and critically, for the *accuracy and freshness of interactive element indices* before performing subsequent actions.*
</tool_instruction>

17. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================
Thought: The `browser_wait_and_get_update` after the `TimeoutError` on `browser_click` shows that the URL has changed from the login page to `http://the-agent-company.com:8092/index.php/apps/files/?dir=%2F&fileid=5`. Additionally, the `webpage accessibility tree` now displays elements like "Files", "Documents", "Downloads", and the username "theagentcompany", which are indicative of a successful login to the OwnCloud file management interface. This confirms that the login process was completed successfully, even though the click action itself timed out.
Final Answer: Successfully logged in to OwnCloud.

Title: Subtask Completion Report: Login to OwnCloud

Checklist Details:
- **URL Verification**:
    - **Goal**: Confirm that the current URL of the browser is 'http://the-agent-company.com:8092/index.php/apps/files/?dir=%2F&fileid=5' to verify successful navigation away from the login page.
    - **Result**: PASSED. The browser's URL at step 13 of the Task Agent's execution trajectory is indeed 'http://the-agent-company.com:8092/index.php/apps/files/?dir=%2F&fileid=5', confirming navigation to the expected post-login page.
- **Post-Login Elements Presence**:
    - **Goal**: Verify the presence of key file management interface elements such as 'Files', 'Documents', 'Downloads', and the logged-in username 'theagentcompany' in the browser's accessibility tree.
    - **Result**: PASSED. The `webpage accessibility tree` at step 13 clearly shows the presence of "Files" (as a heading), "theagentcompany" (as link text), "Documents" (as a link), and "Downloads" (as a link), indicating the successful display of the file management interface.
- **Login Elements Absence**:
    - **Goal**: Verify that login-specific elements (e.g., username input field, password input field, login button) are no longer present in the browser's interactive elements list or accessibility tree.
    - **Result**: PASSED. The `webpage interactive elements` at step 13 do not contain any of the login-specific input fields or buttons that were present on the login page, confirming the successful transition away from the login form.

Conclusion:
The Subtask "Login to OwnCloud" is **complete**. All verification checks based on the Task Agent's execution trajectory and observations confirm that the agent successfully logged into the OwnCloud platform and landed on the expected file management interface, with the login elements no longer present.

- **URL Verification**:
    - **Goal**: Confirm that the current browser URL contains 'dir=%2FDocuments%2FAdmin' and the domain is 'http://the-agent-company.com:8092'.
    - **Result**: PASSED. The browser URL at step 05 is `http://the-agent-company.com:8092/index.php/apps/files?dir=%2FDocuments%2FAdmin&fileid=188`, which confirms successful navigation to the target directory on the correct domain.
- **Page Title Verification**:
    - **Goal**: Check the `RootWebArea` title in the `webpage accessibility tree` to confirm it includes 'Admin - Files - ownCloud'.
    - **Result**: PASSED. The `RootWebArea` title at step 05 is `'Admin - Files - ownCloud'`, which indicates the correct directory context.
- **Target File Presence**:
    - **Goal**: Verify the presence of 'office_sales_chat_history.jpg' as a link or static text within the `webpage accessibility tree`.
    - **Result**: PASSED. The `webpage accessibility tree` at step 05 and step 07 clearly shows a link for `'office_sales_chat_history .jpg ShareActions'` with the URL `http://the-agent-company.com:8092/remote.php/webdav/Documents/Admin/office_sales_chat_history.jpg`, confirming the presence of the target file within the directory.
- **Overlay Absence Verification**:
    - **Goal**: Ensure that the 'A safe home for all your data' dialog or any similar obstructive overlay is no longer present in the `webpage accessibility tree`.
    - **Result**: PASSED. At step 05, the `webpage accessibility tree` shows a `dialog` element containing the text "A safe home for all your data". After the Task Agent sent the 'Escape' key at step 06, the `webpage accessibility tree` at step 07 no longer contains this dialog, confirming its absence.

Conclusion:
The Subtask "Navigate to Documents/Admin directory" is **complete**. All verification checks based on the Task Agent's execution trajectory and observations confirm that the agent successfully navigated to the 'Documents/Admin' directory, the page title is correct, the target file is present, and any obstructive overlays have been dismissed.

Goal: Accurately extract the monthly rental cost and area for Office Type B from the 'office_sales_chat_history.jpg' image.
45. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================
Thought: I need to extract rental information from the downloaded image. The `extract_image_content_by_gpt4o` tool is designed for this purpose. I should check the `System` application guide for any relevant entries on extracting data from images.
Action:
<tool_call>

<ExtractDataFromImage>
{'preconditions': 'An image file (e.g., PNG, JPEG) exists. The specific information to be extracted is known.', 'steps': 'extract_image_content_by_gpt4o(image_path="/workspace/<image_file_path>", query="<detailed_query_for_image_content>")', 'notes': 'Use absolute paths (e.g., `/workspace/your_image.png`). This tool leverages `gpt-4o`. Accuracy depends on image clarity and `query` specificity. Review tool response for accuracy. For charts, common queries include: "Describe the <chart_type>. What is the title? List all categories and their corresponding values/percentages/bar heights.". If direct structured data extraction (e.g., JSON) is unreliable for precise numerical details, try querying for a *detailed natural language description* of the relevant content. Then, use `System: ExtractStructuredDataFromNaturalLanguage` to programmatically parse this description into the desired structured format. Always manually verify critical numerical data against source data, as visual models may provide approximate values (e.g., \'Approximately 100\').'}

47. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================
Thought: I have accessed the guide for `ExtractDataFromImage` and confirmed that `extract_image_content_by_gpt4o` is the appropriate tool. The guide stresses the importance of a detailed query. I need to extract the monthly rental cost and area for Office Type B from the `office_sales_chat_history.jpg` image. I will formulate a query to specifically ask for this information.
Action:
<tool_call>
{"name": "extract_image_content_by_gpt4o", "arguments": {"image_path": "/workspace/office_sales_chat_history.jpg", "query": "What is the monthly rental cost and area for Office Type B? Please provide the numerical values only."}}

1399, 96
</tool_response>
<tool_instruction>
After extraction, always rigorously review the output for accuracy, completeness, and adherence to requested formatting. Recognize that visual models may misinterpret details or omit information, especially in ambiguous visual contexts. For critical numerical or structured data, consider a two-step approach: first, extract a detailed natural language description, and then programmatically parse that description for precise values. Robust programmatic parsing and validation are often required, especially when consolidating results from multiple images (e.g., multi-page PDFs). If a specific keyword or phrase is being sought, a more targeted query may improve results.
</tool_instruction>

49. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================
Thought: The `extract_image_content_by_gpt4o` tool returned "1399, 96" in response to the query "What is the monthly rental cost and area for Office Type B? Please provide the numerical values only.". This output directly provides the numerical values for the monthly rental cost and area, which is exactly what was requested for this subtask. Therefore, the subtask of extracting rental information from the image is complete.
Final Answer: The monthly rental cost for Office Type B is 1399 and the area is 96.

Title: Subtask Completion Report: Extract rental information from image

Checklist Details:
- **tool_usage_verification**:
    - **Goal**: Verify that the Task Agent called the `extract_image_content_by_gpt4o` tool with the correct `image_path` (`/workspace/office_sales_chat_history.jpg`) and a `query` that specifically asks for the 'monthly rental cost and area for Office Type B' and requests 'numerical values only'.
    - **Result**: PASSED. The `tool_call` at step 04 of the Task Agent's execution trajectory clearly shows the correct `image_path` and the `query` "What is the monthly rental cost and area for Office Type B? Please provide the numerical values only.", matching the requirement.
- **extracted_content_validation**:
    - **Goal**: Confirm that the `tool_response` from the `extract_image_content_by_gpt4o` tool (at step 05 of the Task Agent's execution trajectory) is '1399, 96', which directly provides the two numerical values requested by the query.
    - **Result**: PASSED. The `tool_response` at step 05 is indeed "1399, 96", directly providing the expected numerical values.
- **agent_interpretation_accuracy**:
    - **Goal**: Verify that the Task Agent's 'Final Answer' accurately identifies '1399' as the monthly rental cost for Office Type B and '96' as the area, consistent with the order and content implied by its query and the `tool_response`.
    - **Result**: PASSED. The Task Agent's 'Final Answer' at step 06, "The monthly rental cost for Office Type B is 1399 and the area is 96", accurately interprets the extracted values based on the query's phrasing and the order of the tool's response.

Conclusion:
The Subtask "Extract rental information from image" is **complete**. All verification checks confirm that the Task Agent correctly used the image extraction tool, received the expected numerical output, and accurately interpreted these numbers as the monthly rental cost and area for Office Type B.
