Returns a JSON object with `execution_status`, `returncode`, `stdout`, and `stderr`. **Important Precautions**: 1) `returncode=0` does not guarantee successful side effects (e.g., file creation); always verify with independent checks (`ls -l`, `file`). 2) **This tool executes commands in a *minimal* shell environment. Complex shell features like command chaining (`&&`, `||`), pipes (`|`), I/O redirection (`>`, `>>`), and backgrounding (`&`) are often *not reliably interpreted by `run_cmd` directly* and can lead to unexpected behavior or errors (e.g., `SyntaxError`, `command not found`). For any non-trivial shell interaction or complex logic, *always prefer consolidating operations into a single Python script that uses `subprocess` for explicit control and robustness* over multiple `run_cmd` calls or complex shell syntax.** 3) Quote arguments containing spaces (`\"path with spaces\"`). 4) State changes (`cd`) do not persist across calls.", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"command": {"type": "string", "description": "shell command string."}}, "required": ["command"]}}}
</tools>

2. **Python Code Execution**
When executing Python code, please output:
<code>
... your code ...
</code>
- The working directory is `/workspace`
- Executing dangerous, destructive, or time-consuming code is prohibited.
- If both a **Tool Call** and **Python Code Execution** are included in the output, the tool call takes precedence, and the Python code will not be executed.
- Using outdated or limited python libraries may result in incomplete or inaccurate observations (e.g. missing images from PDFs or failing to extract key content). Always prefer robust, modern libraries to ensure full and reliable results.
- When performing file conversion or data extraction, always ensure **data integrity**. Verify that the structure, content, and critical fields of the source file are preserved in the output. Check row and column counts, headers, and key values before and after processing. **Avoid silent loss**, truncation, or unintended alteration of data.

## Action Execution Result Processing
- After each action is executed, an Observation is returned, which includes:
    1. `<tool_response>`: The result of the tool or code execution.
    2. `<tool_instruction>`: The instruction associated with a specific action, used to guide the next step or restrict subsequent behavior.
- **Note**: Do not fabricate observations.

## Security and Restrictions
- **Coding Actions (such as Python, CMD, etc.)**
    - Do not run high-risk operations that are large in code size or take a long time.
    - Do not execute code that could cause data loss, system damage, or irreversible changes.
    - Do not use the kill command with wildcards like * or other dangerous parameters that could result in a wide range of matches.
    - Prefer using the Python interpreter to execute code (safer and more efficient) rather than using the CMD tool.

> ⚠️ **Important**
> When your output contains content that fully conforms to the **Tool Call** or **Python Code Execution** format, the system will immediately parse, identify, and execute it as an **Action** without further confirmation and without reversal.
> Therefore, before outputting, always confirm that this is your **intended** action and fully assess the potential consequences and risks.
> If you are only using **quotes, demonstrations, or examples**, be sure to break the formatting or escape it to prevent the system from interpreting it as a real action.

# OBJECTIVE #
Your core objective is to independently and efficiently complete the tasks assigned to you by the company.


# MEMORY #
During previous tasks, you have accumulated the following reusable knowledge:

## Resolution Patterns
Comprehensive Contextualization: Systematically acquire and aggregate information from diverse, potentially unstructured sources, prioritizing local processing and cross-validation, to ensure a complete, coherent operational view and inform robust decisions.
Robust External Interaction: Prioritize stable, predictable interaction methods, such as structured APIs, and dynamically adapt strategies to ensure continuity and reliability with external systems despite their inconsistencies or volatility.
Adaptive Constraint Handling: When an objective is blocked by an unresolvable external constraint, acknowledge the limitation, perform necessary cleanup of partial artifacts, and adapt the strategy to proceed with viable data, avoiding unproductive retries.
Modular Resilient Design: Decompose operations into modular, decoupled units with explicit state management, to enhance predictability, isolate errors, improve maintainability, and ensure operational continuity.
Progressive Verification: Implement multi-stage validation, from granular checks within pipelines to comprehensive outcome validation, to localize errors, confirm system states, and ensure successful execution.

## Platform/Application Operation Guides

> This directory provides a comprehensive index of guides, compiling best practices and experience summaries for accomplishing various tasks.

### Recommended Usage Process
1. **Review the Guide First**  
   Before starting a task, browse the relevant entries in the directory to identify potentially useful guidance.  
2. **Targeted Access**  
   Use the `access_the_application_guide` tool to view detailed steps if necessary.  
3. **Reuse with Flexibility**  
   Apply past successful steps when they fit the current situation, but stay aware of possible mismatches.  
4. **Explore When Deviations Arise**  
   If the environment or results diverge from the guide, stop rigidly following it and explore alternative approaches through small, safe, and adaptive steps.

### Value of Guides
- Reduce task completion time by leveraging accumulated experience.  
- Lower error rates and avoid common pitfalls.  
- Ensure consistent, professional execution of tasks.  

### Guide Reliability & Adaptation
- Guides may be outdated, biased, or contain errors — they are “historical experience,” not absolute truth.  
- Use guides as starting points, not as strict rules.  
- When deviations or conflicts appear, **exit the guide and explore new paths** instead of persisting.  
- Record useful deviation points for later improvement of the guides.

**Title**: Subtask Completion Report: RocketChat Login

**Checklist Details**:
1. **Verify RocketChat Dashboard Elements**: Passed. The `webpage accessibility tree` and `webpage interactive elements` from Observation 11 show the presence of dashboard elements such as 'Home', 'Search', 'Directory', 'Administration' buttons, and channel lists (`Janusgraph`, `general`, `kudos`, `chen_xinyi`, `mike_chen`), confirming successful navigation to the RocketChat dashboard.
2. **Verify Absence of Login Form**: Passed. The `webpage accessibility tree` and `webpage interactive elements` from Observation 11 confirm that the login form elements (username/password input fields and the login button) are no longer present on the page. This indicates that the login process has completed and the form has been replaced by the dashboard interface.

**Conclusion**:
The Task Agent has successfully completed Subtask 1: "Login to RocketChat". All verification steps indicate a successful login and transition to the RocketChat dashboard, with no login form elements remaining on the page.

The current subtask has been successfully completed, and substantial new information has been obtained.  
Carefully review the updated context and determine how this new knowledge impacts the overall task progress.  
Design the next subtask to effectively leverage these insights and move closer to completing the full task.

Always remember that your ultimate goal is to complete task:
<task>
There is an all hands meeting. You need to collect the feedback of everyone who attended. 
You should first ask Huang Jie for names of all the participants, using http://the-agent-company.com:3000/.
Then, ask each of the participant for feedback and score (1-5) about the meeting, using http://the-agent-company.com:3000/.
You will need to write the feedback and scores in an excel file named '/workspace/meeting_feedback.xlsx'. In the excel file, put the headers ['Name', 'Feedback', 'Score'] in the first row, and put everyone's record in the following rows.
If someone did not respond to your message, you should still put in his/her name in the excel file, but no values in the 'Feedback' and 'Score' columns.
</task>
19. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================
* The information you know and have obtained is:
    1. The goal is to collect feedback and scores (1-5) from all participants of an all-hands meeting.
    2. Communication will be done via RocketChat, accessible at `http://the-agent-company.com:3000/`.
    3. The first step is to ask "Huang Jie" for the names of all participants.
    4. After getting the participant list, each person needs to be individually messaged for their feedback and score (1-5).
    5. The collected data must be saved in an Excel file named `/workspace/meeting_feedback.xlsx`.
    6. The Excel file should have the headers `['Name', 'Feedback', 'Score']` in the first row.
    7. For participants who do not respond, their name should still be included in the Excel file, with empty values for 'Feedback' and 'Score'.
    8. RocketChat account details are: `email: theagentcompany`, `password: theagentcompany`.
    9. I have successfully logged in to RocketChat.

* The task can be divided into the following subtasks:
    1. Request participant list from Huang Jie: Send a message to 'Huang Jie' on RocketChat asking for the names of all participants who attended the all-hands meeting and receive a response containing the list of names.
    2. Parse participant names: Extract and store the individual names of all participants from Huang Jie's response into a list.
    3. Send feedback requests to participants: Iterate through the parsed participant list and send a message to each individual on RocketChat, requesting their feedback and score (1-5) for the meeting.
    4. Collect and consolidate feedback: Monitor for responses from participants for a reasonable amount of time, extract their feedback and score, and store this information. For participants who do not respond within the timeframe, record their name with empty feedback and score fields.
    5. Create and populate Excel report: Generate an Excel file named '/workspace/meeting_feedback.xlsx' with the columns 'Name', 'Feedback', and 'Score', and populate it with all collected and placeholder feedback data.

Replace `<target_name>` with the actual username or channel name. For channels, the search bar generally works with or without the '#' prefix. Successful navigation is verified by inspecting the `webpage accessibility tree` for the correct chat heading (e.g., `heading '<target_name>'`) and URL (e.g., `http://the-agent-company.com:3000/direct/<user_id>` or `http://the-agent-company.com:3000/channel/<channel_name>`).

2.  **Validate parsing logic**: Passed. The Task Agent's parsing logic (combining the code from Action 04 and Action 06) was independently re-executed. The output from this independent execution, `['Huang Jie', 'Mike Chen', 'Emily Zhou', 'Liu Qiang', 'Chen Xinyi']` (Observation of `validate_parsing_logic`), perfectly matches the output observed in the Task Agent's trajectory (Observation 07). This confirms the correctness and reliability of the parsing process.

**Conclusion**: The Task Agent has successfully completed Subtask 3: "Parse Participant Names". The participant names were accurately parsed from the input string into a clean Python list, and the logic used for this process has been verified to be correct and reliable.

The Check Agent reports that the current Subtask has been completed. The above is the check report from the Check Agent.

The current subtask has been successfully completed, and substantial new information has been obtained.  
Carefully review the updated context and determine how this new knowledge impacts the overall task progress.  
Design the next subtask to effectively leverage these insights and move closer to completing the full task.

Always remember that your ultimate goal is to complete task:
<task>
There is an all hands meeting. You need to collect the feedback of everyone who attended. 
You should first ask Huang Jie for names of all the participants, using http://the-agent-company.com:3000/.
Then, ask each of the participant for feedback and score (1-5) about the meeting, using http://the-agent-company.com:3000/.
You will need to write the feedback and scores in an excel file named '/workspace/meeting_feedback.xlsx'. In the excel file, put the headers ['Name', 'Feedback', 'Score'] in the first row, and put everyone's record in the following rows.
If someone did not respond to your message, you should still put in his/her name in the excel file, but no values in the 'Feedback' and 'Score' columns.
</task>
53. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================
* The information you know and have obtained is:
    1. The goal is to collect feedback and scores (1-5) from all participants of an all-hands meeting.
    2. Communication will be done via RocketChat, accessible at `http://the-agent-company.com:3000/`.
    3. The first step is to ask "Huang Jie" for the names of all participants.
    4. After getting the participant list, each person needs to be individually messaged for their feedback and score (1-5).
    5. The collected data must be saved in an Excel file named `/workspace/meeting_feedback.xlsx`.
    6. The Excel file should have the headers `['Name', 'Feedback', 'Score']` in the first row.
    7. For participants who do not respond, their name should still be included in the Excel file, with empty values for 'Feedback' and 'Score'.
    8. RocketChat account details are: `email: theagentcompany`, `password: theagentcompany`.
    9. I have successfully logged in to RocketChat.
    10. I have successfully obtained the participant list from Huang Jie: "Huang Jie, Mike Chen, Emily Zhou, Liu Qiang, and Chen Xinyi."
    11. I have successfully parsed the participant names into a Python list: `['Huang Jie', 'Mike Chen', 'Emily Zhou', 'Liu Qiang', 'Chen Xinyi']`.

* The task can be divided into the following subtasks:
    1. Request Feedback from Participants: For each participant in the parsed list, initiate a direct message conversation on RocketChat, send a message requesting their feedback and a score (1-5) about the meeting, and record their response or mark them as non-responsive within a reasonable timeframe.
    2. Generate Excel Report: Create an Excel file named '/workspace/meeting_feedback.xlsx', add the headers ['Name', 'Feedback', 'Score'] to the first row, and populate the following rows with each participant's name, their collected feedback and score, or empty values if no response was received.

Thought: I have the guides and a clear plan. I will start by initializing the data structure for feedback. Then, I will iterate through the participants. For each participant, I will navigate to their chat, send the feedback request, wait for a response, extract and parse the response, and store the data. Finally, I will return to the home page to prepare for the next participant.

I have already interacted with "Huang Jie" in the previous subtask, so I am currently in the direct message conversation with "huang_jie". I will start by sending the feedback request to Huang Jie.

First, I will define the list of participants and an empty list to store the feedback.
Then, I will send the message to Huang Jie. I need to identify the message input field again.
From the previous observations (Observation 16), the message input field was at index 80. I will re-verify this with `browser_wait_and_get_update()`.

If an `Element index does not exist` error is returned, it indicates extreme element volatility. **Always re-evaluate `webpage interactive elements` with `browser_wait_and_get_update` immediately before attempting a click, and crucially, confirm the element's `text` or `aria-label` attribute semantically matches the intended target.** If direct clicking by index proves unreliable, *especially within dynamic lists or sidebars (e.g., chat contact lists)*, consider alternative strategies like using an application's built-in search functionality or `browser_go_to_url` if a direct link is known, rather than repeatedly retrying. For form submissions or general action triggers, `browser_send_keys` with 'Enter' is a more robust alternative and **highly recommended for reliability**.

**Title**: Subtask Completion Report: Request Feedback from Participants

**Checklist Details**:
1.  **Verify Emily Zhou Message Sent**: Passed. The `webpage accessibility tree` in Observation 41 clearly shows the message "Hi Emily Zhou, could you please provide your feedback and a score (1-5) for the all-hands meeting?" was successfully sent by 'theagentcompany'.
2.  **Check Emily Zhou Response Presence**: Passed. After an additional `browser_wait_and_get_update` (initiated by the Task Result Checking Agent), a response from 'emily_zhou' was observed in the `webpage accessibility tree`. The response content includes feedback and a score: "Hi there! I found the all-hands meeting quite informative and helpful. I'd give it a score of 4. It was great to get updates on different projects and see how everything is aligning. Looking forward to more discussions like these!".
3.  **Verify Remaining Participants Unprocessed**: Passed. Analysis of the Task Agent's execution trajectory confirms that no actions (sending messages or attempting to collect feedback) have been taken for 'Liu Qiang' and 'Chen Xinyi' within the provided trace. The trajectory concludes after sending the message to Emily Zhou.
4.  **Verify Partial Feedback Data Content**: Passed. The `stdout` from Observation 29 shows the `feedback_data` list currently contains entries for 'Huang Jie' and 'Mike Chen' with their correctly extracted feedback and scores. However, it does not yet include 'Emily Zhou's feedback, and naturally not 'Liu Qiang' or 'Chen Xinyi's. This indicates that while Emily Zhou has responded, her data has not yet been processed and added to the `feedback_data` list by the Task Agent.

**Conclusion**:
The Subtask "Request Feedback from Participants" is **not complete**. While the Task Agent has successfully sent messages and received responses from Huang Jie, Mike Chen, and Emily Zhou, it has not yet processed and stored Emily Zhou's feedback into the `feedback_data` list. More critically, the Task Agent has not yet initiated contact or collected feedback from all participants (specifically 'Liu Qiang' and 'Chen Xinyi'), which is a core requirement of the subtask goal. The task still requires iterative processing for the remaining participants and the final compilation of all feedback.
</check_report>

Based on analyzing the current Subtask, its goal, and **your Subtask's execution trajectory**, the Check Agent reports that the current Subtask has failed to complete. The above is the Check Agent's check report.
Please combine this check report with the current Subtask's historical execution trajectory to analyze the key obstacles currently hindering task completion and develop an actionable plan for the next steps.


97. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================
* The current Subtask still has the following issues:
    1. The feedback and score from Emily Zhou's response have not been extracted and stored into the `feedback_data` list.
    2. The Task Agent has not yet contacted all participants (specifically 'Liu Qiang' and 'Chen Xinyi') to request their feedback and score, as required by the subtask.

* Consider trying the following actions:
    1. Process Emily Zhou's response: Extract the feedback text and numerical score (1-5) from Emily Zhou's message using Python code to parse the string content, and then append this data (name, feedback, score) to the `feedback_data` list.
    2. Access and send messages to remaining participants: Iterate through the remaining participants ('Liu Qiang' and 'Chen Xinyi'). For each participant:
        a. Navigate to their direct message conversation using the `AccessConversation` guide (which may involve searching for their name if not directly visible).
        b. Send the feedback request message.
        c. Wait for a response using `browser_wait_and_get_update` with a sufficient timeout (e.g., 5 seconds).
        d. Extract the feedback and score from the response using string parsing, similar to how Emily Zhou's response will be processed.
        e. If no response is received within the timeout, record their name with empty feedback and score in the `feedback_data` list.

SubTask4: Request Feedback from Participants
Goal: For each participant in the parsed list, initiate a direct message conversation on RocketChat, send a message requesting their feedback and a score (1-5) about the meeting, and record their response or mark them as non-responsive within a reasonable timeframe.
The goal of this subtask has not been achieved yet, please continue

**Title**: Subtask Completion Report: Request Feedback from Participants

**Checklist Details**:
1.  **Verify All Participants Processed**: Passed. The `feedback_data` list in Observation 83 contains entries for all expected participants: 'Huang Jie', 'Mike Chen', 'Emily Zhou', 'Liu Qiang', and 'Chen Xinyi'.
2.  **Verify Huang Jie Feedback**: Passed. Huang Jie's feedback `('I found the all-hands meeting to be quite informative and helpful.', Score: 4)` in Observation 83 matches the response observed in Observation 11.
3.  **Verify Mike Chen Feedback**: Passed. Mike Chen's feedback `('Hey there! I found the all-hands meeting to be really informative and helpful. I think it covered all the necessary points and provided great insights into our current projects.', Score: 5)` in Observation 83 matches the response observed in Observation 27.
4.  **Verify Emily Zhou Feedback**: Passed. Emily Zhou's feedback `('I found the all-hands meeting quite informative and helpful. It was great to get updates on different projects and see how everything is aligning. Looking forward to more discussions like these!', Score: 4)` in Observation 83 matches the response observed in Observation 43.
5.  **Verify Liu Qiang Feedback**: Passed. Liu Qiang's feedback `("I found the all-hands meeting to be quite helpful in aligning everyone with the company's current goals and updates.", Score: 4)` in Observation 83 matches the response observed in Observation 61.
6.  **Verify Chen Xinyi Non-Responsive**: Passed. Chen Xinyi's entry in Observation 83 shows empty 'Feedback' and 'Score' fields (`{'Name': 'Chen Xinyi', 'Feedback': '', 'Score': ''}`), which correctly reflects the absence of a response in Observation 81.

**Conclusion**:
The Task Agent has successfully completed Subtask 4: "Request Feedback from Participants". All participants have been contacted, and their feedback (or lack thereof) has been correctly extracted and stored in the `feedback_data` list as verified by all checklist items.

The current subtask has been successfully completed, and substantial new information has been obtained.  
Carefully review the updated context and determine how this new knowledge impacts the overall task progress.  
Design the next subtask to effectively leverage these insights and move closer to completing the full task.

Always remember that your ultimate goal is to complete task:
<task>
There is an all hands meeting. You need to collect the feedback of everyone who attended. 
You should first ask Huang Jie for names of all the participants, using http://the-agent-company.com:3000/.
Then, ask each of the participant for feedback and score (1-5) about the meeting, using http://the-agent-company.com:3000/.
You will need to write the feedback and scores in an excel file named '/workspace/meeting_feedback.xlsx'. In the excel file, put the headers ['Name', 'Feedback', 'Score'] in the first row, and put everyone's record in the following rows.
If someone did not respond to your message, you should still put in his/her name in the excel file, but no values in the 'Feedback' and 'Score' columns.

* The information you know and have obtained is:
    1. The goal is to collect feedback and scores (1-5) from all participants of an all-hands meeting.
    2. Communication will be done via RocketChat, accessible at `http://the-agent-company.com:3000/`.
    3. The collected data must be saved in an Excel file named `/workspace/meeting_feedback.xlsx`.
    4. The Excel file should have the headers `['Name', 'Feedback', 'Score']` in the first row.
    5. For participants who do not respond, their name should still be included in the Excel file, with empty values for 'Feedback' and 'Score'.
    6. RocketChat account details are: `email: theagentcompany`, `password: theagentcompany`.
    7. I have successfully logged in to RocketChat.
    8. I have successfully obtained the raw participant list from Huang Jie: "Huang Jie, Mike Chen, Emily Zhou, Liu Qiang, and Chen Xinyi."
    9. I have successfully parsed the participant names into a Python list: `['Huang Jie', 'Mike Chen', 'Emily Zhou', 'Liu Qiang', 'Chen Xinyi']`.
    10. I have collected feedback and scores from all participants, stored in a list of dictionaries named `feedback_data`:
        `[{'Name': 'Huang Jie', 'Feedback': 'I found the all-hands meeting to be quite informative and helpful.', 'Score': 4}, {'Name': 'Mike Chen', 'Feedback': 'Hey there! I found the all-hands meeting to be really informative and helpful. I think it covered all the necessary points and provided great insights into our current projects.', 'Score': 5}, {'Name': 'Emily Zhou', 'Feedback': 'I found the all-hands meeting quite informative and helpful. It was great to get updates on different projects and see how everything is aligning.

**Title**: Subtask Completion Report: Generate Excel Report

**Checklist Details**:
1.  **Verify Excel File Existence and Type**: Passed. The `run_cmd` tool confirmed the existence of `/workspace/meeting_feedback.xlsx` and identified it as a "Microsoft Excel 2007+" file, matching the expected file format and confirming its successful creation (Observation from `CheckStep:Verify_Excel_File_Existence_and_Type`).
2.  **Verify Excel File Headers**: Passed. A Python script executed via `run_cmd` successfully read the Excel file and extracted its column headers as `['Name', 'Feedback', 'Score']`, which precisely matches the required headers specified in the subtask goal (Observation from `CheckStep:Verify_Excel_File_Headers`).
3.  **Verify Excel File Content Integrity**: Passed with clarification. An initial direct comparison indicated a "Content mismatch" (Observation from `CheckStep:Verify_Excel_File_Content_Integrity`). However, further analysis revealed that the discrepancies were due to standard pandas data type conversions when reading from Excel: integer scores (e.g., `4`) were converted to floats (`4.0`), and empty strings (`''`) were represented as `'nan'`. These conversions are expected pandas behavior and were even noted as a potential minor difference in the `WriteExcelFileXLSX` guide (Observation 03). Crucially, no information was lost, and the data accurately reflects the `feedback_data` used by the Task Agent (Observation 06).

**Conclusion**:
The Task Agent has successfully completed Subtask 5: "Generate Excel Report". The Excel file `/workspace/meeting_feedback.xlsx` was created, contains the specified headers, and accurately stores all collected participant feedback and scores, including proper handling of non-responsive participants. The data integrity is confirmed, accounting for expected data type transformations by pandas.

Please comprehensively review the entire task execution process, including all subtasks and the contextual information collected.  
Cross-check carefully against the overall task requirements:

1. **Completeness Check**: Ensure every aspect of the requirements has been addressed. Confirm that no items were skipped, postponed, or only partially completed.  
2. **Consistency Check**: Verify that all intermediate results are logically coherent and data-wise consistent with the final conclusions. There should be no contradictions, missing steps, or unexplained gaps.  
3. **Final Completion Confirmation**:  
   - If any requirements remain unfinished or results are insufficient, explicitly list the next subtasks to resolve them.  
   - If all requirements are fully and correctly met, return an empty task plan to indicate the task is completely finished.
