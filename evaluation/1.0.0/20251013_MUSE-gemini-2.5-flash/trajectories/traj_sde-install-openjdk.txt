</tools>

2. **Python Code Execution**
When executing Python code, please output:
<code>
... your code ...
</code>
- The working directory is `/workspace`
- Executing dangerous, destructive, or time-consuming code is prohibited.
- If both a **Tool Call** and **Python Code Execution** are included in the output, the tool call takes precedence, and the Python code will not be executed.
- Using outdated or limited python libraries may result in incomplete or inaccurate observations (e.g. missing images from PDFs or failing to extract key content). Always prefer robust, modern libraries to ensure full and reliable results.
- When performing file conversion or data extraction, always ensure **data integrity**. Verify that the structure, content, and critical fields of the source file are preserved in the output. Check row and column counts, headers, and key values before and after processing. **Avoid silent loss**, truncation, or unintended alteration of data.

## Action Execution Result Processing
- After each action is executed, an Observation is returned, which includes:
    1. `<tool_response>`: The result of the tool or code execution.
    2. `<tool_instruction>`: The instruction associated with a specific action, used to guide the next step or restrict subsequent behavior.
- **Note**: Do not fabricate observations.

## Security and Restrictions
- **Coding Actions (such as Python, CMD, etc.)**
    - Do not run high-risk operations that are large in code size or take a long time.
    - Do not execute code that could cause data loss, system damage, or irreversible changes.
    - Do not use the kill command with wildcards like * or other dangerous parameters that could result in a wide range of matches.
    - Prefer using the Python interpreter to execute code (safer and more efficient) rather than using the CMD tool.

> ⚠️ **Important**
> When your output contains content that fully conforms to the **Tool Call** or **Python Code Execution** format, the system will immediately parse, identify, and execute it as an **Action** without further confirmation and without reversal.
> Therefore, before outputting, always confirm that this is your **intended** action and fully assess the potential consequences and risks.
> If you are only using **quotes, demonstrations, or examples**, be sure to break the formatting or escape it to prevent the system from interpreting it as a real action.

# OBJECTIVE #
Your core objective is to independently and efficiently complete the tasks assigned to you by the company.


# MEMORY #
During previous tasks, you have accumulated the following reusable knowledge:

## Resolution Patterns
Comprehensive Contextualization: Systematically acquire and aggregate information from diverse, potentially unstructured sources, prioritizing local processing and cross-validation, to ensure a complete, coherent operational view and inform robust decisions.
Robust External Interaction: Prioritize stable, predictable interaction methods, such as structured APIs, and dynamically adapt strategies to ensure continuity and reliability with external systems despite their inconsistencies or volatility.
Adaptive Constraint Handling: When an objective is blocked by an unresolvable external constraint, acknowledge the limitation, perform necessary cleanup of partial artifacts, and adapt the strategy to proceed with viable data, avoiding unproductive retries.
Modular Resilient Design: Decompose operations into modular, decoupled units with explicit state management, to enhance predictability, isolate errors, improve maintainability, and ensure operational continuity.
Progressive Verification: Implement multi-stage validation, from granular checks within pipelines to comprehensive outcome validation, to localize errors, confirm system states, and ensure successful execution.

## Platform/Application Operation Guides
These guides summarize proven operation paths derived from past successful experiences.  
Each item is a structured reference designed to help you complete operations more quickly, accurately, and with reduced redundancy.

> This directory provides a comprehensive index of guides, compiling best practices and experience summaries for accomplishing various tasks.

### Recommended Usage Process
1. **Review the Guide First**  
   Before starting a task, browse the relevant entries in the directory to identify potentially useful guidance.  
2. **Targeted Access**  
   Use the `access_the_application_guide` tool to view detailed steps if necessary.  
3. **Reuse with Flexibility**  
   Apply past successful steps when they fit the current situation, but stay aware of possible mismatches.  
4. **Explore When Deviations Arise**  
   If the environment or results diverge from the guide, stop rigidly following it and explore alternative approaches through small, safe, and adaptive steps.

### Value of Guides
- Reduce task completion time by leveraging accumulated experience.  
- Lower error rates and avoid common pitfalls.  
- Ensure consistent, professional execution of tasks.  

### Guide Reliability & Adaptation
- Guides may be outdated, biased, or contain errors — they are “historical experience,” not absolute truth.  
- Use guides as starting points, not as strict rules.  
- When deviations or conflicts appear, **exit the guide and explore new paths** instead of persisting.  
- Record useful deviation points for later improvement of the guides.

Install OpenJDK 17
</task>
03. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================
* The information you know and have obtained is:
    1.  The task requires installing OpenJDK 17.
    2.  OpenJDK can typically be installed using a system package manager (like `apt` or `yum`) or by manually downloading and extracting a binary distribution.
    3.  After installation, it's important to verify the correct version is installed using `java -version`.
    4.  Environment variables such as `JAVA_HOME` might need to be configured for the installed OpenJDK to be properly recognized by applications.

* The task can be divided into the following subtasks:
    1. Check existing Java installation: Determine if Java is already installed and identify any existing versions.
    2. Update package lists: Ensure the local package index is up-to-date to find the latest OpenJDK 17 packages.
    3. Install OpenJDK 17: Successfully install OpenJDK 17 using the system's package manager.
    4. Verify OpenJDK 17 installation: Confirm that OpenJDK 17 is correctly installed and set as the default Java version.

SubTask1: Check existing Java installation
Goal: Determine if Java is already installed and identify any existing versions.
05. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================
Thought: The subtask is to check for existing Java installations. I will use the `run_cmd` tool to execute shell commands to check for Java. The relevant guide entry is `System - ExecuteShellCommand`.
Action:
<tool_call>
{"name": "access_the_application_guide", "arguments": {"application_name": "System", "item_names": ["ExecuteShellCommand"]}}
</tool_call>
06. | ================================================== USER MESSAGE ==================================================
Observation:

Analyze `stderr` for errors, `stdout` for output. `run_cmd` operates in isolated environments; `cd` does not persist across `run_cmd` calls. When using `subprocess`, use `check=True` to raise `CalledProcessError` on non-zero exit codes for robust error handling. `capture_output=True` is essential for getting stdout/stderr."}
</ExecuteShellCommand>
</Application>
</tool_response>
<tool_instruction>
After accessing, carefully read the guide content. Extract and adapt relevant steps, recognizing that guide information may be outdated or require UI verification. Always prioritize current browser state by performing `browser_wait_and_get_update()` immediately before attempting to follow guide steps.
</tool_instruction>

07. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================
Thought: I have accessed the guide for `ExecuteShellCommand`. The guide suggests using `run_cmd` for simple commands. To check for existing Java installations, I will use the `java -version` command.
Action:
<tool_call>
{"name": "run_cmd", "arguments": {"command": "java -version"}}
</tool_call>
08. | ================================================== USER MESSAGE ==================================================
Observation: 
<tool_response>
{
  "execution_status": "TOOL_FAILURE_COMMAND_NOT_FOUND",
  "stderr": "❌ 命令执行失败: 系统中未找到 'java' 这个命令。"
}
</tool_response>
<tool_instruction>
Always check `command_result.returncode`: `0` indicates success; non-zero suggests an error; analyze `command_result.stderr`. For successful commands, process `command_result.stdout`. *Note: `command_result.stderr` may contain non-error information; evaluate contextually.* **Crucially, for any sequence of shell commands or when integrating shell output with Python logic, *always encapsulate the entire interaction within a single Python script using `subprocess`* for maximum robustness and control, rather than relying on discrete `run_cmd` calls or shell features like redirection.**
</tool_instruction>

09. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================
Thought: The `java -version` command resulted in a `COMMAND_NOT_FOUND` error, which indicates that Java is not currently installed on the system or is not accessible via the default PATH. This fulfills the goal of checking for existing Java installations, as the check confirmed its absence.
Final Answer: No existing Java installation found.
10. | ================================================== USER MESSAGE ==================================================
<check_report>
**Title**: Subtask 1: Check existing Java installation Verification Report

**Checklist Details**:

1.  **Verify Java -version Output**:
    *   **Task Agent's Observation (from trajectory)**: The `run_cmd` tool's execution of `java -version` resulted in `execution_status: TOOL_FAILURE_COMMAND_NOT_FOUND`. The `stderr` message clearly indicated that the 'java' command was not found in the system ("❌ 命令执行失败: 系统中未找到 'java' 这个命令。").
    *   **Verification**: This output unequivocally confirms that the `java` command is not recognized, implying Java is either not installed or not accessible via the system's PATH. The Task Agent's interpretation of this result was accurate.

2.  **Check 'which java' Command**:
    *   **Proactive Action**: Executed the `which java` command via `run_cmd`.
    *   **Observation**: The command returned `returncode: 1`, with both `stdout` and `stderr` being empty.
    *   **Verification**: A `returncode` of 1 for the `which` command signifies that the specified executable ('java') could not be located in any directory listed in the system's PATH. This provides direct, independent confirmation of the absence of a discoverable Java installation.

**Conclusion**:

The Subtask "Check existing Java installation" is **complete**. Both the Task Agent's initial check using `java -version` and our independent verification using `which java` consistently demonstrate that Java is not installed or accessible on the system. The Task Agent's conclusion, "No existing Java installation found," is fully verified and correct.
</check_report>

The Check Agent reports that the current Subtask has been completed. The above is the check report from the Check Agent.

Goal: Ensure the local package index is up-to-date to find the latest OpenJDK 17 packages.
15. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================
Thought: The subtask is to update package lists. This will involve using a shell command. I will use the `System - ExecuteShellCommand` guide to understand how to execute shell commands.
Action:
<tool_call>
{"name": "access_the_application_guide", "arguments": {"application_name": "System", "item_names": ["ExecuteShellCommand"]}}

Analyze `stderr` for errors, `stdout` for output. `run_cmd` operates in isolated environments; `cd` does not persist across `run_cmd` calls. When using `subprocess`, use `check=True` to raise `CalledProcessError` on non-zero exit codes for robust error handling. `capture_output=True` is essential for getting stdout/stderr."}

After accessing, carefully read the guide content. Extract and adapt relevant steps, recognizing that guide information may be outdated or require UI verification. Always prioritize current browser state by performing `browser_wait_and_get_update()` immediately before attempting to follow guide steps.
</tool_instruction>

17. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================
Thought: I have accessed the `ExecuteShellCommand` guide. To update the package lists, I will use the `sudo apt-get update` command, which is standard for Debian-based systems. I will execute this command using `run_cmd`.
Action:
<tool_call>
{"name": "run_cmd", "arguments": {"command": "sudo apt-get update"}}

</tool_response>
<tool_instruction>
Always check `command_result.returncode`: `0` indicates success; non-zero suggests an error; analyze `command_result.stderr`. For successful commands, process `command_result.stdout`. *Note: `command_result.stderr` may contain non-error information; evaluate contextually.* **Crucially, for any sequence of shell commands or when integrating shell output with Python logic, *always encapsulate the entire interaction within a single Python script using `subprocess`* for maximum robustness and control, rather than relying on discrete `run_cmd` calls or shell features like redirection.**
</tool_instruction>

19. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================
Thought: The previous attempt to update package lists failed because the `sudo` command was not found. This suggests a minimal execution environment. I will now try to run `apt-get update` directly, without `sudo`, to see if it's possible to update package lists as a non-root user. While unlikely to succeed, it's a necessary step to diagnose the environment's capabilities.

21. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================
Thought: The `apt-get update` command executed successfully, indicated by `returncode: 0` and the `stdout` showing that package lists were fetched and read. This means the local package index is now up-to-date. Therefore, this subtask is complete.
Final Answer: Package lists have been successfully updated.

<check_report>
**Title**: Subtask 2: Update package lists Verification Report

**Checklist Details**:

1.  **Verify `apt-get update` execution and output**:
    *   **Task Agent's Action**: The Task Agent executed the `run_cmd` tool with the command `apt-get update` at step 06 of the trajectory.
    *   **Task Agent's Observation (from trajectory)**: At step 07, the `tool_response` indicated `execution_status: "COMMAND_EXECUTED"` and `command_result.returncode: 0`. The `stdout` displayed messages consistent with a successful package list update, including "Hit:1 ... InRelease", "Get:3 ... InRelease", "Fetched 429 kB in 1s (437 kB/s)", and "Reading package lists...".
    *   **Verification**: The `returncode: 0` definitively confirms the command's success. The `stdout` content further validates that the package lists were fetched and read, indicating that the local package index is now up-to-date.

**Conclusion**:

The Subtask "Update package lists" is **complete**. The `apt-get update` command was executed successfully, and the system's package lists are confirmed to be up-to-date, thereby meeting the subtask's objective.

Got it! I'll continue with the task.
24. | ================================================== USER MESSAGE ==================================================
The current subtask has been successfully completed, and substantial new information has been obtained.  
Carefully review the updated context and determine how this new knowledge impacts the overall task progress.  
Design the next subtask to effectively leverage these insights and move closer to completing the full task.

Always remember that your ultimate goal is to complete task:
<task>
Install OpenJDK 17
</task>
25. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================
* The information you know and have obtained is:
    1. The overall task is to install OpenJDK 17.
    2. OpenJDK can typically be installed using a system package manager (like `apt` or `yum`) or by manually downloading and extracting a binary distribution.
    3. After installation, it's important to verify the correct version is installed using `java -version`.
    4. Environment variables such as `JAVA_HOME` might need to be configured for the installed OpenJDK to be properly recognized by applications.
    5. Subtask 1, "Check existing Java installation," has been completed. The system currently does not have Java installed, as confirmed by `java -version` returning "command not found" and `which java` returning a non-zero exit code.
    6. Subtask 2, "Update package lists," has been completed. The `apt-get update` command executed successfully, and the system's package lists are now up-to-date.

* The task can be divided into the following subtasks:
    1. Install OpenJDK 17: Successfully install OpenJDK 17 using the system's package manager.
    2. Verify OpenJDK 17 installation: Confirm that OpenJDK 17 is correctly installed and set as the default Java version by checking the output of `java -version` and ensuring it shows OpenJDK 17.
26. | ================================================== USER MESSAGE ==================================================
SubTask3: Install OpenJDK 17
Goal: Successfully install OpenJDK 17 using the system's package manager.

Always check `command_result.returncode`: `0` indicates success; non-zero suggests an error; analyze `command_result.stderr`. For successful commands, process `command_result.stdout`. *Note: `command_result.stderr` may contain non-error information; evaluate contextually.* **Crucially, for any sequence of shell commands or when integrating shell output with Python logic, *always encapsulate the entire interaction within a single Python script using `subprocess`* for maximum robustness and control, rather than relying on discrete `run_cmd` calls or shell features like redirection.**
</tool_instruction>

31. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================
Thought: The `apt-get install -y openjdk-17-jdk` command executed successfully, as indicated by `returncode: 0`. The `stdout` clearly shows the installation process, including the downloading and setting up of `openjdk-17-jdk` and its related components. The `stderr` message is a warning about `debconf` and `apt-utils` and does not indicate a failure in the OpenJDK installation itself. Therefore, the goal of successfully installing OpenJDK 17 has been achieved.
Final Answer: OpenJDK 17 has been successfully installed.

**Title**: Subtask 3: Install OpenJDK 17 Verification Report

**Checklist Details**:

1.  **Verify `java -version` Output**:
    *   **Task Agent's Action**: The Task Agent executed `apt-get install -y openjdk-17-jdk` at step 04 of the trajectory, which resulted in `returncode: 0` and `stdout` indicating successful installation of `openjdk-17-jdk` and related packages.
    *   **Proactive Action**: Executed the `java -version` command via `run_cmd`.
    *   **Observation**: The command returned `returncode: 0`. The `stderr` output contained: `"openjdk version "17.0.16" 2025-07-15 OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 17.0.16+8-Debian-1deb11u1) OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (build 17.0.16+8-Debian-1deb11u1, mixed mode, sharing)"`.
    *   **Verification**: This output confirms that OpenJDK version 17.0.16 has been successfully installed and is recognized by the system.

2.  **Verify `which java` Command Output**:
    *   **Task Agent's Action**: (Implicitly covered by the successful installation of the OpenJDK 17 package).
    *   **Proactive Action**: Executed the `which java` command via `run_cmd`.
    *   **Observation**: The command returned `returncode: 0`, with `stdout` showing `/usr/bin/java`.
    *   **Verification**: A `returncode` of 0 and the output `/usr/bin/java` for the `which` command confirm that the `java` executable is now correctly located within the system's PATH and is discoverable.

**Conclusion**:

The Subtask "Install OpenJDK 17" is **complete**. The `apt-get install` command executed by the Task Agent successfully installed OpenJDK 17, as evidenced by the `returncode: 0` in the trajectory. Our proactive checks with `java -version` and `which java` independently confirm that OpenJDK 17 (version 17.0.16) is indeed installed and properly configured in the system's PATH, fully meeting the subtask's objective.

Got it! I'll continue with the task.
34. | ================================================== USER MESSAGE ==================================================
The current subtask has been successfully completed, and substantial new information has been obtained.  
Carefully review the updated context and determine how this new knowledge impacts the overall task progress.  
Design the next subtask to effectively leverage these insights and move closer to completing the full task.

Always remember that your ultimate goal is to complete task:
<task>
Install OpenJDK 17
</task>
35. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================
* The information you know and have obtained is:
    1. The overall task is to install OpenJDK 17.
    2. OpenJDK can typically be installed using a system package manager (like `apt` or `yum`) or by manually downloading and extracting a binary distribution.
    3. After installation, it's important to verify the correct version is installed using `java -version`.
    4. Environment variables such as `JAVA_HOME` might need to be configured for the installed OpenJDK to be properly recognized by applications.
    5. Subtask 1, "Check existing Java installation," has been completed. It was confirmed that Java was not previously installed on the system.
    6. Subtask 2, "Update package lists," has been completed. The `apt-get update` command was successfully executed, ensuring package lists are current.
    7. Subtask 3, "Install OpenJDK 17," has been completed. OpenJDK 17 (version 17.0.16) has been successfully installed on the system using `apt-get install -y openjdk-17-jdk`, and the `java` executable is now available in the system's PATH.

* The task can be divided into the following subtasks:
    1. Determine OpenJDK 17 installation path: Identify the file system path to the OpenJDK 17 installation directory (e.g., /usr/lib/jvm/java-17-openjdk-amd64) to be used for setting JAVA_HOME.
    2. Configure JAVA_HOME environment variable: Permanently set the JAVA_HOME environment variable to the identified OpenJDK 17 installation path, and ensure it is available for all relevant user sessions and applications.

SubTask4: Determine OpenJDK 17 installation path
Goal: Identify the file system path to the OpenJDK 17 installation directory (e.g., /usr/lib/jvm/java-17-openjdk-amd64) to be used for setting JAVA_HOME.

Analyze `stderr` for errors, `stdout` for output. `run_cmd` operates in isolated environments; `cd` does not persist across `run_cmd` calls. When using `subprocess`, use `check=True` to raise `CalledProcessError` on non-zero exit codes for robust error handling. `capture_output=True` is essential for getting stdout/stderr."}

Thought: I have accessed the `ExecuteShellCommand` guide. To determine the OpenJDK 17 installation path, I will use the command `readlink -f $(which java)`. This command will resolve the symbolic link for the `java` executable to its actual location, from which I can infer the `JAVA_HOME` path.

**Title**: Subtask 4: Determine OpenJDK 17 installation path Verification Report

**Checklist Details**:

1.  **Verify `which java` Output**:
    *   **Task Agent's Observation (from trajectory)**: At step 07, the `run_cmd` tool's execution of `which java` resulted in `returncode: 0` and `stdout: "/usr/bin/java"`.
    *   **Proactive Action**: Executed `which java` via `run_cmd`.
    *   **Observation**: The command returned `returncode: 0` and `stdout: "/usr/bin/java"`.
    *   **Verification**: This output confirms that the `java` executable is indeed located at `/usr/bin/java`, consistent with the Task Agent's findings.

2.  **Verify `readlink -f /usr/bin/java` Output**:
    *   **Task Agent's Observation (from trajectory)**: At step 09, the `run_cmd` tool's execution of `readlink -f /usr/bin/java` resulted in `returncode: 0` and `stdout: "/usr/lib/jvm/java-17-openjdk-amd64/bin/java"`. The Task Agent then correctly deduced the `JAVA_HOME` path as `/usr/lib/jvm/java-17-openjdk-amd64` in step 10.
    *   **Proactive Action**: Executed `readlink -f /usr/bin/java` via `run_cmd`.
    *   **Observation**: The command returned `returncode: 0` and `stdout: "/usr/lib/jvm/java-17-openjdk-amd64/bin/java"`.
    *   **Verification**: This result independently confirms the full path to the `java` executable and, by extension, the correct OpenJDK 17 installation directory as `/usr/lib/jvm/java-17-openjdk-amd64` (after removing the `/bin/java` suffix), aligning perfectly with the Task Agent's conclusion.

**Conclusion**:\
The Subtask "Determine OpenJDK 17 installation path" is **complete**. The Task Agent successfully identified the `java` executable path and subsequently resolved the full installation directory for OpenJDK 17. Our proactive checks independently verified both the `java` executable's location and the derived OpenJDK 17 installation path, confirming the Task Agent's conclusion that the installation path is `/usr/lib/jvm/java-17-openjdk-amd64`.

49. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================
* The information you know and have obtained is:
    1. The overall task is to install OpenJDK 17.
    2. Java was not initially installed on the system, as confirmed by `java -version` returning "command not found".
    3. The system's package lists were successfully updated using `apt-get update`.
    4. OpenJDK 17 (specifically version 17.0.16) has been successfully installed on the system using `apt-get install -y openjdk-17-jdk`.
    5. The `java` executable is now correctly set up in the system's PATH, resolving to `/usr/bin/java`.
    6. The determined installation path for OpenJDK 17, which will be used for the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable, is `/usr/lib/jvm/java-17-openjdk-amd64`.

* The task can be divided into the following subtasks:
    1. Configure JAVA_HOME environment variable: Permanently set the JAVA_HOME environment variable to '/usr/lib/jvm/java-17-openjdk-amd64' for system-wide availability.
    2. Verify OpenJDK 17 installation: Confirm that OpenJDK 17 is correctly installed and is the default Java version by verifying the output of 'java -version'.

**Title**: Subtask 6: Verify OpenJDK 17 installation Verification Report

**Checklist Details**:

1.  **Verify `java -version` Output Globally**:
    *   **Task Agent's Observation (from trajectory)**: At step 05, the `run_cmd` tool's execution of `java -version` resulted in `execution_status: "COMMAND_EXECUTED"` and `command_result.returncode: 0`. The `stderr` output contained: `"openjdk version "17.0.16" 2025-07-15\\nOpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 17.0.16+8-Debian-1deb11u1)\\nOpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (build 17.0.16+8-Debian-1deb11u1, mixed mode, sharing)"`.

    *   **Verification**: Both the Task Agent's execution and our independent verification confirm that the `java -version` command, when executed globally (without explicit sourcing), correctly identifies OpenJDK 17 (version 17.0.16). This indicates that the `JAVA_HOME` and `PATH` environment variables are properly configured and recognized system-wide, making OpenJDK 17 the default Java version.

**Conclusion**:

The Subtask "Verify OpenJDK 17 installation" is **complete**. The `java -version` command consistently reports OpenJDK 17 (version 17.0.16) as the default Java version globally, both in the Task Agent's trajectory and in our proactive checks. This confirms that OpenJDK 17 is correctly installed and accessible without explicit profile sourcing, fully meeting the subtask's objective.

    3. The system's package lists were successfully updated using `apt-get update`.
    4. OpenJDK 17 (specifically version 17.0.16+8-Debian-1deb11u1) was successfully installed using the command `apt-get install -y openjdk-17-jdk`. This process included the installation of `openjdk-17-jre-headless`, `openjdk-17-jre`, `openjdk-17-jdk-headless`, and `openjdk-17-jdk` along with their dependencies.
    5. The installation path for OpenJDK 17 was determined to be `/usr/lib/jvm/java-17-openjdk-amd64` by resolving the symbolic link of the `java` executable (`/usr/bin/java`) using `readlink -f`.
    6. The `JAVA_HOME` environment variable was permanently configured to `/usr/lib/jvm/java-17-openjdk-amd64` for system-wide availability by creating and populating the file `/etc/profile.d/openjdk.sh` with `export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-17-openjdk-amd64` and `export PATH=$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH`.
    7. The configuration of `JAVA_HOME` and `PATH` was verified by sourcing the `openjdk.sh` script and echoing `$JAVA_HOME` within a `bash -c` command, which correctly returned `/usr/lib/jvm/java-17-openjdk-amd64`.
    8. A final global verification using `java -version` (without explicit sourcing) confirmed that OpenJDK 17 (version "17.0.16") is now recognized as the default Java version on the system.

* The task can be divided into the following subtasks:
