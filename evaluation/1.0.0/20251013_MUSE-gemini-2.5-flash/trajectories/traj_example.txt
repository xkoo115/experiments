# ACTION #
During task execution, you can perform **Actions**, including:
1. **Tool Call**
2. **Python Code Execution**

## Action Output Format
1. **Tool Call**
When calling a tool, please output:
<tool_call>
{"name": "<function-name>", "arguments": <args-json-object>}
</tool_call>
- `<function-name>`: Tool function name
- `<args-json-object>`: Call arguments (JSON format)
- If multiple `<tool_call>` are output at once, only the first one will be executed; the rest will be ignored.

Available tool signatures are provided within the `<tools>` tag:
<tools>
{"type": "function", "function": {"name": "extract_image_content_by_gpt4o", "description": "Utilizes `gpt-4o` to interpret and extract content from local image files (e.g., PNG, JPEG). Highly effective for **scanned documents, image-based PDFs (post-conversion to image formats),** or visual data. For optimal extraction, craft precise queries. **Caution: While effective for general content, direct numerical or highly structured extraction from complex visual elements (e.g., tally marks, handwritten notes) may be imprecise; robust post-processing is often required. For multi-page documents, convert each page into a separate image and ensure *all* generated image pages are processed for complete data extraction.**", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"image_path": {"type": "string", "description": "Local image path."}, "query": {"type": "string", "description": "Query to the gpt-4o to get the image content."}}, "required": ["image_path", "query"]}}}

Element indices are dynamic and highly volatile; always verify the target element's existence and index using `browser_wait_and_get_update` immediately before clicking. Be aware that even with immediate updates, indices can shift in very dynamic UIs. Crucially, after clicking, always use `browser_wait_and_get_update` to immediately re-evaluate the page state and confirm the intended effect (e.g., UI changes, navigation). For navigation, `browser_go_to_url` is a more robust alternative when a direct URL is known. For form submissions or general action triggers, `browser_send_keys` with 'Enter' is often a more robust alternative, especially when direct clicking by index proves unreliable. Avoid clicking elements that are not currently visible or interactable.", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"index": {"type": "integer", "description": "The index number of the target element."}}, "required": ["index"]}}}

It cannot process content that is scrolled out of view or exists on other pages of a paginated list. While `accessibility tree` and `interactive elements` are primary for UI understanding, this visual tool can be a highly effective *primary* method for text extraction in challenging scenarios. **Crucially, for critical or structured data (e.g., IDs, specific names, numerical values), always cross-verify with or prefer extraction from the `webpage accessibility tree` as visual interpretation may introduce inaccuracies, especially for abbreviated or visually ambiguous elements.**", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"query": {"type": "string", "description": "Query to the VL model to get the browser page content."}}, "required": ["query"]}}}

The `webpage interactive elements` from its output are highly dynamic and should be used immediately. For verifying responses or dynamic updates, consider setting `seconds` to a value appropriate for expected latency (e.g., `seconds=1` for immediate state, longer for human-like response times). **This tool is a fundamental prerequisite for almost all subsequent browser interactions due to the highly dynamic nature of web UI element indices.**", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"seconds": {"type": "integer", "description": "The number of seconds to wait, the default is 3 seconds.", "default": 3}}, "required": []}}}

Returns a JSON object with `execution_status`, `returncode`, `stdout`, and `stderr`. **Important Precautions**: 1) `returncode=0` does not guarantee successful side effects (e.g., file creation); always verify with independent checks (`ls -l`, `file`). 2) **This tool executes commands in a *minimal* shell environment. Complex shell features like command chaining (`&&`, `||`), pipes (`|`), I/O redirection (`>`, `>>`), and backgrounding (`&`) are often *not reliably interpreted by `run_cmd` directly* and can lead to unexpected behavior or errors (e.g., `SyntaxError`, `command not found`). For any non-trivial shell interaction or complex logic, *always prefer consolidating operations into a single Python script that uses `subprocess` for explicit control and robustness* over multiple `run_cmd` calls or complex shell syntax.** 3) Quote arguments containing spaces (`\"path with spaces\"`). 4) State changes (`cd`) do not persist across calls.", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"command": {"type": "string", "description": "command暂时没有参数描述"}}, "required": ["command"]}}}
</tools>

2. **Python Code Execution**
When executing Python code, please output:
<code>
... your code ...
</code>
- The working directory is `/workspace`
- Executing dangerous, destructive, or time-consuming code is prohibited.
- If both a **Tool Call** and **Python Code Execution** are included in the output, the tool call takes precedence, and the Python code will not be executed.
- Using outdated or limited python libraries may result in incomplete or inaccurate observations (e.g. missing images from PDFs or failing to extract key content). Always prefer robust, modern libraries to ensure full and reliable results.
- When performing file conversion or data extraction, always ensure **data integrity**. Verify that the structure, content, and critical fields of the source file are preserved in the output. Check row and column counts, headers, and key values before and after processing. **Avoid silent loss**, truncation, or unintended alteration of data.

## Action Execution Result Processing
- After each action is executed, an Observation is returned, which includes:
    1. `<tool_response>`: The result of the tool or code execution.
    2. `<tool_instruction>`: The instruction associated with a specific action, used to guide the next step or restrict subsequent behavior.
- **Note**: Do not fabricate observations.

## Security and Restrictions
- **Coding Actions (such as Python, CMD, etc.)**
    - Do not run high-risk operations that are large in code size or take a long time.
    - Do not execute code that could cause data loss, system damage, or irreversible changes.
    - Do not use the kill command with wildcards like * or other dangerous parameters that could result in a wide range of matches.
    - Prefer using the Python interpreter to execute code (safer and more efficient) rather than using the CMD tool.

> ⚠️ **Important**
> When your output contains content that fully conforms to the **Tool Call** or **Python Code Execution** format, the system will immediately parse, identify, and execute it as an **Action** without further confirmation and without reversal.
> Therefore, before outputting, always confirm that this is your **intended** action and fully assess the potential consequences and risks.
> If you are only using **quotes, demonstrations, or examples**, be sure to break the formatting or escape it to prevent the system from interpreting it as a real action.

# OBJECTIVE #
Your core objective is to independently and efficiently complete the tasks assigned to you by the company.


# MEMORY #
During previous tasks, you have accumulated the following reusable knowledge:

## Resolution Patterns
Comprehensive Contextualization: Systematically acquire and aggregate information from diverse, potentially unstructured sources, prioritizing local processing and cross-validation, to ensure a complete, coherent operational view and inform robust decisions.
Robust External Interaction: Prioritize stable, predictable interaction methods, such as structured APIs, and dynamically adapt strategies to ensure continuity and reliability with external systems despite their inconsistencies or volatility.
Adaptive Constraint Handling: When an objective is blocked by an unresolvable external constraint, acknowledge the limitation, perform necessary cleanup of partial artifacts, and adapt the strategy to proceed with viable data, avoiding unproductive retries.
Modular Resilient Design: Decompose operations into modular, decoupled units with explicit state management, to enhance predictability, isolate errors, improve maintainability, and ensure operational continuity.
Progressive Verification: Implement multi-stage validation, from granular checks within pipelines to comprehensive outcome validation, to localize errors, confirm system states, and ensure successful execution.

## Platform/Application Operation Guides
These guides summarize proven operation paths derived from past successful experiences.  
Each item is a structured reference designed to help you complete operations more quickly, accurately, and with reduced redundancy.

> This directory provides a comprehensive index of guides, compiling best practices and experience summaries for accomplishing various tasks.

### Recommended Usage Process
1. **Review the Guide First**  
   Before starting a task, browse the relevant entries in the directory to identify potentially useful guidance.  
2. **Targeted Access**  
   Use the `access_the_application_guide` tool to view detailed steps if necessary.  
3. **Reuse with Flexibility**  
   Apply past successful steps when they fit the current situation, but stay aware of possible mismatches.  
4. **Explore When Deviations Arise**  
   If the environment or results diverge from the guide, stop rigidly following it and explore alternative approaches through small, safe, and adaptive steps.

### Value of Guides
- Reduce task completion time by leveraging accumulated experience.  
- Lower error rates and avoid common pitfalls.  
- Ensure consistent, professional execution of tasks.  

### Guide Reliability & Adaptation
- Guides may be outdated, biased, or contain errors — they are “historical experience,” not absolute truth.  
- Use guides as starting points, not as strict rules.  
- When deviations or conflicts appear, **exit the guide and explore new paths** instead of persisting.  
- Record useful deviation points for later improvement of the guides.

**Title**: Subtask Completion Verification Report for "Access Rocket.Chat and contact Alex Turner for internal wiki"

**Checklist Details**:
1.  **verify_rocketchat_login**: **CONFIRMED**. The Task Agent successfully logged into Rocket.Chat.
    *   **Evidence**: Observation 11's `webpage accessibility tree` displays dashboard elements (e.g., 'Home', 'Search' buttons, channel lists) and a clear absence of the login form elements previously visible in Observation 5.
2.  **verify_message_sent_to_alex_turner**: **CONFIRMED**. The message 'Hi Alex, could you please provide me with the link to our internal wiki?' was successfully sent to Alex Turner.
    *   **Evidence**: Observation 21's `webpage accessibility tree` clearly shows a `paragraph` element containing the sent message, preceded by `StaticText 'theagentcompany'`, confirming the message was posted.
3.  **verify_wiki_link_received**: **CONFIRMED**. A reply was received from 'alex_turner' containing the specific wiki link 'http://the-agent-company.com:8929/root/doc/-/wikis.'.
    *   **Evidence**: Observation 23's `webpage accessibility tree` explicitly shows `StaticText 'alex_turner'` followed by a message containing the clickable `link 'http://the-agent-company.com:8929/root/doc/-/wikis.'`.
4.  **access_provided_wiki_link**: **CONFIRMED**. The wiki link provided by Alex Turner is valid and accessible.
    *   **Evidence**: Proactive navigation to `http://the-agent-company.com:8929/root/doc/-/wikis.` resulted in a successful redirect to a GitLab sign-in page (`http://the-agent-company.com:8929/users/sign_in`), as seen in the `webpage accessibility tree` after the proactive action. This verifies the link is live and points to the correct service.

**Conclusion**: The Subtask "Access Rocket.Chat and contact Alex Turner for internal wiki" is **COMPLETE**. All verification steps have confirmed that the Task Agent successfully logged into Rocket.Chat, communicated with Alex Turner, obtained the internal wiki link, and the link itself was verified to be valid and accessible.

Thought: I have navigated to the wiki link provided by Alex Turner, but it resulted in a "404: Page not found" error. This indicates that the direct wiki link is not functional, even though I am logged into GitLab. I need to find the wiki through the GitLab interface. I am currently on the GitLab homepage (`http://the-agent-company.com:8929/`) after successfully logging in. I need to find a way to access the wiki from here. The usual way to access a wiki in GitLab is through a project.

As per the `ExecuteShellCommand` guide, for such scenarios, it's better to use a single command that directly specifies the path or encapsulate it in a Python script using `subprocess`. In this case, `pip install -r` can take a direct path to the `requirements.txt` file.

So, the next step is to install the Python dependencies using `pip install -r /workspace/api-server/requirements.txt`. After that, I will need to inspect `server.py` to understand how to start the server.

Thought: The previous attempt to run the server in the background timed out because `run_cmd` expects a command to complete, but the `&` operator puts the process in the background, preventing `run_cmd` from ever receiving a completion signal. To correctly run the server in the background and detach it, I need to use `nohup`. This will allow the server to continue running even after the `run_cmd` execution finishes. I will also redirect output to a log file for debugging. After starting, I will use `curl` to verify the server is accessible.

This indicates that `run_cmd` is not designed for long-running, detached processes. As per the `tool_instruction` and best practices for robust shell interactions, I need to use a Python script with the `subprocess` module to properly launch the API server in the background.

I will create a Python script named `start_server.py` in `/workspace` that uses `subprocess.Popen` to run `python /workspace/api-server/server.py` in a detached manner. I will redirect stdout and stderr to `/dev/null` to prevent them from keeping the parent process (this script) alive or filling up logs unnecessarily. After creating and executing this script, I will verify the server's status by making a `curl` request to `http://localhost:5432/welcome`.

<check_report>
**Title**: Subtask Completion Verification Report for "Start API Server in Background"

**Checklist Details**:
1.  **verify_server_process_listening**: **CONFIRMED**. A process is actively listening on port 5432.
    *   **Evidence**: Although direct `netstat` or `ss` commands were not available in the environment, the successful `curl` request to `http://localhost:5432/welcome` with `returncode: 0` and `stdout: "{\"message\":\"Welcome to the Flask API!\"}"` in Observation 23 of the Task Agent's trajectory implicitly confirms that a server process was running and listening on port 5432.
2.  **verify_server_welcome_endpoint_response**: **CONFIRMED**. The `curl` request to `http://localhost:5432/welcome` returned the expected JSON response.
    *   **Evidence**: Observation 23 explicitly shows the `stdout` from the `curl http://localhost:5432/welcome` command as `{"message":"Welcome to the Flask API!"}`, which precisely matches the expected response body. The `returncode` was `0`, indicating a successful HTTP request.

**Conclusion**: The Subtask "Start API Server in Background" is **COMPLETE**. The API server dependencies were installed, the server was successfully started in the background using a Python `subprocess` script, and its running status and expected endpoint response were confirmed.

After inputting text, always use `browser_wait_and_get_update` to verify the text input, check for immediate validation feedback, or confirm any UI changes (e.g., enable/disable buttons, form submission readiness). Be especially mindful of index volatility, as UI changes can rapidly invalidate previously retrieved indices.

**Title**: Subtask Completion Verification Report for "Ask Alex Turner for Next Introduction"

**Checklist Details**:
1.  **verify_message_sent_to_alex_turner**: **CONFIRMED**. The message 'Hi Alex, I\'ve successfully started the API server. Who should I introduce myself to next on the team?' was successfully sent to Alex Turner.
    *   **Evidence**: Observation 13\'s `webpage accessibility tree` explicitly shows a `paragraph` element containing the sent message: `StaticText "Hi Alex, I've successfully started the API server. Who should I introduce myself to next on the team?"`, preceded by `StaticText 'theagentcompany'` and a timestamp, confirming the message was posted.
2.  **verify_message_input_field_cleared**: **CONFIRMED**. The message input field was cleared after the message was sent.
    *   **Evidence**: In Observation 11, the `webpage accessibility tree` explicitly shows the `textbox 'Message'` containing the message text: `StaticText "Hi Alex, I've successfully started the API server. Who should I introduce myself to next on the team?", editable='plaintext'`. In contrast, after sending the message in Observation 13, the `webpage interactive elements` for the input field at index 79 shows: `{"index": 79, "tag": "textarea", "text": "<textarea name=msg placeholder=Message/>", "placeholder": "Message"}`, and the corresponding `label` at index 78 is empty `{"index": 78, "tag": "label", "text": "<label/>"}`. The absence of the message text within the `textarea` or `label` after sending confirms that the input field was cleared.

**Conclusion**: The Subtask "Ask Alex Turner for Next Introduction" is **COMPLETE**. The Task Agent successfully navigated to Alex Turner's direct message, sent the specified message, and the message input field was cleared, indicating successful delivery.

Got it! I'll continue with the task.
126. | ================================================== USER MESSAGE ==================================================
Please comprehensively review the entire task execution process, including all subtasks and the contextual information collected.  
Cross-check carefully against the overall task requirements:

1. **Completeness Check**: Ensure every aspect of the requirements has been addressed. Confirm that no items were skipped, postponed, or only partially completed.  
2. **Consistency Check**: Verify that all intermediate results are logically coherent and data-wise consistent with the final conclusions. There should be no contradictions, missing steps, or unexplained gaps.  
3. **Final Completion Confirmation**:  
   - If any requirements remain unfinished or results are insufficient, explicitly list the next subtasks to resolve them.  
   - If all requirements are fully and correctly met, return an empty task plan to indicate the task is completely finished.  

Always remember that your ultimate goal is to complete task:
<task>
Find our company's API server codebase in our internal wiki, clone the API server
repository to /workspace folder, and start up the API server locally.
Keep the API server running in background. You could use http://the-agent-company.com:3000/
to ask Alex Turner for the internal wiki. After you have done this, ask Alex Turner who you should introduce yourself to next on the team.
</task>

* The information you know and have obtained is:
    1. The main objective is to find the company's API server codebase in the internal wiki, clone it to `/workspace`, start the API server locally in the background, and then ask Alex Turner who to introduce myself to next.
    2. Rocket.Chat service URL: `http://the-agent-company.com:3000/`.
    3. Rocket.Chat login credentials: `theagentcompany` (email), `theagentcompany` (password).
    4. The internal wiki link was initially provided by Alex Turner as `http://the-agent-company.com:8929/root/doc/-/wikis.`, but this link was found to be broken.
    5. GitLab service URL: `http://the-agent-company.com:8929`.
