Returns a JSON object with `execution_status`, `returncode`, `stdout`, and `stderr`. **Important Precautions**: 1) `returncode=0` does not guarantee successful side effects (e.g., file creation); always verify with independent checks (`ls -l`, `file`). 2) **This tool executes commands in a *minimal* shell environment. Complex shell features like command chaining (`&&`, `||`), pipes (`|`), I/O redirection (`>`, `>>`), and backgrounding (`&`) are often *not reliably interpreted by `run_cmd` directly* and can lead to unexpected behavior or errors (e.g., `SyntaxError`, `command not found`). For any non-trivial shell interaction or complex logic, *always prefer consolidating operations into a single Python script that uses `subprocess` for explicit control and robustness* over multiple `run_cmd` calls or complex shell syntax.** 3) Quote arguments containing spaces (`\"path with spaces\"`). 4) State changes (`cd`) do not persist across calls.", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"command": {"type": "string", "description": "command暂时没有参数描述"}}, "required": ["command"]}}}
</tools>

2. **Python Code Execution**
When executing Python code, please output:
<code>
... your code ...
</code>
- The working directory is `/workspace`
- Executing dangerous, destructive, or time-consuming code is prohibited.
- If both a **Tool Call** and **Python Code Execution** are included in the output, the tool call takes precedence, and the Python code will not be executed.
- Using outdated or limited python libraries may result in incomplete or inaccurate observations (e.g. missing images from PDFs or failing to extract key content). Always prefer robust, modern libraries to ensure full and reliable results.
- When performing file conversion or data extraction, always ensure **data integrity**. Verify that the structure, content, and critical fields of the source file are preserved in the output. Check row and column counts, headers, and key values before and after processing. **Avoid silent loss**, truncation, or unintended alteration of data.

## Action Execution Result Processing
- After each action is executed, an Observation is returned, which includes:
    1. `<tool_response>`: The result of the tool or code execution.
    2. `<tool_instruction>`: The instruction associated with a specific action, used to guide the next step or restrict subsequent behavior.
- **Note**: Do not fabricate observations.

## Security and Restrictions
- **Coding Actions (such as Python, CMD, etc.)**
    - Do not run high-risk operations that are large in code size or take a long time.
    - Do not execute code that could cause data loss, system damage, or irreversible changes.
    - Do not use the kill command with wildcards like * or other dangerous parameters that could result in a wide range of matches.
    - Prefer using the Python interpreter to execute code (safer and more efficient) rather than using the CMD tool.

> ⚠️ **Important**
> When your output contains content that fully conforms to the **Tool Call** or **Python Code Execution** format, the system will immediately parse, identify, and execute it as an **Action** without further confirmation and without reversal.
> Therefore, before outputting, always confirm that this is your **intended** action and fully assess the potential consequences and risks.
> If you are only using **quotes, demonstrations, or examples**, be sure to break the formatting or escape it to prevent the system from interpreting it as a real action.

# OBJECTIVE #
Your core objective is to independently and efficiently complete the tasks assigned to you by the company.


# MEMORY #
During previous tasks, you have accumulated the following reusable knowledge:

## Resolution Patterns
Comprehensive Contextualization: Systematically acquire and aggregate information from diverse, potentially unstructured sources, prioritizing local processing and cross-validation, to ensure a complete, coherent operational view and inform robust decisions.
Robust External Interaction: Prioritize stable, predictable interaction methods, such as structured APIs, and dynamically adapt strategies to ensure continuity and reliability with external systems despite their inconsistencies or volatility.
Adaptive Constraint Handling: When an objective is blocked by an unresolvable external constraint, acknowledge the limitation, perform necessary cleanup of partial artifacts, and adapt the strategy to proceed with viable data, avoiding unproductive retries.
Modular Resilient Design: Decompose operations into modular, decoupled units with explicit state management, to enhance predictability, isolate errors, improve maintainability, and ensure operational continuity.
Progressive Verification: Implement multi-stage validation, from granular checks within pipelines to comprehensive outcome validation, to localize errors, confirm system states, and ensure successful execution.

## Platform/Application Operation Guides
These guides summarize proven operation paths derived from past successful experiences.  
Each item is a structured reference designed to help you complete operations more quickly, accurately, and with reduced redundancy.

> This directory provides a comprehensive index of guides, compiling best practices and experience summaries for accomplishing various tasks.

### Recommended Usage Process
1. **Review the Guide First**  
   Before starting a task, browse the relevant entries in the directory to identify potentially useful guidance.  
2. **Targeted Access**  
   Use the `access_the_application_guide` tool to view detailed steps if necessary.  
3. **Reuse with Flexibility**  
   Apply past successful steps when they fit the current situation, but stay aware of possible mismatches.  
4. **Explore When Deviations Arise**  
   If the environment or results diverge from the guide, stop rigidly following it and explore alternative approaches through small, safe, and adaptive steps.

### Value of Guides
- Reduce task completion time by leveraging accumulated experience.  
- Lower error rates and avoid common pitfalls.  
- Ensure consistent, professional execution of tasks.  

### Guide Reliability & Adaptation
- Guides may be outdated, biased, or contain errors — they are “historical experience,” not absolute truth.  
- Use guides as starting points, not as strict rules.  
- When deviations or conflicts appear, **exit the guide and explore new paths** instead of persisting.  
- Record useful deviation points for later improvement of the guides.

</tool_instruction>

37. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================
Thought: The previous attempts to extract the URL using `browser_extract_content_by_vision` were not successful in getting the full URL. It seems that directly extracting from a specific index using `browser_extract_content_by_vision` is not reliable for this scenario.

Looking at the `webpage interactive elements` from the previous observation, I can see the full URL `http://the-agent-company.com:8929/root/copilot-arena-server.git` is explicitly present as the `StaticText` within the `textbox 'Clone with HTTP'`. I should be able to extract this directly from the `webpage interactive elements` rather than relying on `browser_extract_content_by_vision`.

I will parse the `webpage interactive elements` to find the textbox with the label "Clone with HTTP" and extract its content.

Here's the relevant part from the `webpage interactive elements`:
```json
{"index": 90, "tag": "label", "text": "<label >Clone with HTTP/>"},
// ...
{"index": 89, "tag": "li", "text": "<li/>"},
// ...
{"index": 91, "tag": "button", "text": "<button title=Copy URL type=button/>"},
// ...
```
The actual textbox content is not directly available in the interactive elements as a separate entry with an index. It's nested within a `generic` element under the `textbox 'Clone with HTTP'`.

Let's re-examine the `webpage accessibility tree` for a more reliable way to get the URL.
Under the `button 'Code'`, there's a `list 'Code'`. Inside this list, there's a `listitem` for "Clone with HTTP", and within that, a `textbox 'Clone with HTTP'` which has a `generic` child containing the `StaticText` with the URL.

I will try to use `browser_extract_content_by_vision` one more time, but this time I will be very specific about what I want to extract from the image, specifically the text from the HTTP clone URL field. If that fails, I will resort to parsing the accessibility tree myself in Python.
Action:
<tool_call>

The URL is located within a `StaticText` element that is a child of a `textbox` element labeled 'Clone with HTTP'. I will iterate through the interactive elements to find this specific element and extract its text.

Thought: I have accessed the `InstallPythonPackage` guide. It suggests using `pip install <package_name>`. I need to install all packages listed in `requirements.txt`. The standard command for this is `pip install -r requirements.txt`. I will execute this command in the `/workspace/copilot-arena-server` directory.
Action:
<tool_call>
{"name": "run_cmd", "arguments": {"command": "pip install -r /workspace/copilot-arena-server/requirements.txt"}}
</tool_call>

Always check `command_result.returncode`: `0` indicates success; non-zero suggests an error; analyze `command_result.stderr`. For successful commands, process `command_result.stdout`. *Note: `command_result.stderr` may contain non-error information; evaluate contextually.* **Crucially, for any sequence of shell commands or when integrating shell output with Python logic, *always encapsulate the entire interaction within a single Python script using `subprocess`* for maximum robustness and control, rather than relying on discrete `run_cmd` calls or shell features like redirection.**

55. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================
Thought: The `pip install -r requirements.txt` command executed successfully with a `returncode` of 0. The standard output shows that all required packages were downloaded and installed. The warnings about running pip as root and updating pip are informational and do not prevent the successful installation of the dependencies. Therefore, the subtask of installing Python dependencies is complete.
Final Answer: All packages listed in 'requirements.txt' have been successfully installed in the '/workspace/copilot-arena-server' directory.

Title: Subtask Completion Report for Install Python Dependencies

Checklist Details:
-   **VerifyCommandReturnCode**: Passed. The `pip install -r /workspace/copilot-arena-server/requirements.txt` command executed by the Task Agent returned a `returncode` of `0`, as indicated in Task Agent's Observation 5. This confirms that the installation process reported no errors.
-   **VerifyKeyPackagesAreInstalled**: Passed. Execution of `pip freeze` confirmed the presence of key packages like `fastapi==0.116.1`, `scikit-learn==1.7.2`, and `pandas==2.3.2` in the environment. This directly verifies that the dependencies specified in `requirements.txt` have been successfully installed.

Conclusion: The Subtask "Install Python Dependencies" is complete. All verification checks passed, confirming that the Python packages listed in `requirements.txt` were successfully installed.

Got it! I'll continue with the task.
58. | ================================================== USER MESSAGE ==================================================
The current subtask has been successfully completed, and substantial new information has been obtained.  
Carefully review the updated context and determine how this new knowledge impacts the overall task progress.  
Design the next subtask to effectively leverage these insights and move closer to completing the full task.

Always remember that your ultimate goal is to complete task:
<task>
Find copilot arena's api server codebase in our gitlab (located at http://the-agent-company.com:8929/root/copilot-arena-server)
Pull this repository down to /workspace folder and then install the requirements.txt
Edit the create_pair endpoint so that it now requires the suffix key as an input
At the end, start the server in the background. To start the server, run the command:
uvicorn app:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 5000 --workers 1 --log-config log_conf.yaml&
</task>
59. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================
* The information you know and have obtained is:
    1. The target GitLab repository is `copilot-arena-server` at `http://the-agent-company.com:8929/root/copilot-arena-server`.
    2. The repository needs to be cloned into the `/workspace` directory.
    3. Python dependencies need to be installed from `requirements.txt`.
    4. The `create_pair` endpoint in the codebase must be modified to require a `suffix` key as an input parameter.
    5. The server needs to be started in the background using the command `uvicorn app:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 5000 --workers 1 --log-config log_conf.yaml&`.
    6. I have successfully logged into GitLab.
    7. I have successfully cloned the `copilot-arena-server` repository into `/workspace/copilot-arena-server`.
    8. All Python dependencies from `requirements.txt` have been successfully installed.

* The task can be divided into the following subtasks:
    1. Modify create_pair Endpoint: The 'create_pair' endpoint in the server's codebase is updated to require a 'suffix' key as an input parameter.
    2. Start Server: The 'copilot-arena-server' is running in the background on port 5000.

SubTask4: Modify create_pair Endpoint
Goal: The 'create_pair' endpoint in the server's codebase is updated to require a 'suffix' key as an input parameter.
61. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================
Thought: The current subtask requires me to modify a Python file. I will need to locate the file, read its content, modify it, and then write the changes back. The `System` application guides related to file operations will be useful. Specifically, `LocateFile`, `ReadFile`, and `WriteFile`. I will start by accessing the `LocateFile` guide to understand how to find the relevant file.

Thought: The `ls` command shows `app.py` in the root of the cloned repository. This is a strong candidate for where the `create_pair` endpoint might be defined. I will now read the content of `app.py` to find the `create_pair` endpoint and identify how to modify it.

Always check `command_result.returncode`: `0` indicates success; non-zero suggests an error; analyze `command_result.stderr`. For successful commands, process `command_result.stdout`. *Note: `command_result.stderr` may contain non-error information; evaluate contextually.* **Crucially, for any sequence of shell commands or when integrating shell output with Python logic, *always encapsulate the entire interaction within a single Python script using `subprocess`* for maximum robustness and control, rather than relying on discrete `run_cmd` calls or shell features like redirection.**

Thought: I have reviewed the content of `app.py`. The `create_pair` endpoint currently checks for `prefix`, `userId`, and `privacy` as required inputs, and `suffix` is optional with a default empty string. To make `suffix` a required input, I need to modify the `if` condition that checks for missing keys and update the corresponding error message. I will read the file content, perform the string replacement, and then write the updated content back to `app.py`.

Here's the plan:
1. Read the content of `/workspace/copilot-arena-server/app.py`.
2. Replace the line `or "privacy" not in data` with `or "privacy" not in data or "suffix" not in data`.
3. Replace the line `error_msg = "Request must contain keys: [prefix, userId, privacy]"` with `error_msg = "Request must contain keys: [prefix, userId, privacy, suffix]"`.
4. Write the modified content back to the file.

Always check `command_result.returncode`: `0` indicates success; non-zero suggests an error; analyze `command_result.stderr`. For successful commands, process `command_result.stdout`. *Note: `command_result.stderr` may contain non-error information; evaluate contextually.* **Crucially, for any sequence of shell commands or when integrating shell output with Python logic, *always encapsulate the entire interaction within a single Python script using `subprocess`* for maximum robustness and control, rather than relying on discrete `run_cmd` calls or shell features like redirection.**

Thought: I have reviewed the content of `app.py` after the modification. The `if` condition for checking required keys now includes `"suffix" not in data`, and the `error_msg` now includes `suffix` in the list of required keys. This confirms that the `create_pair` endpoint has been successfully updated to require the `suffix` key as an input.
Final Answer: The 'create_pair' endpoint in the server's codebase has been updated to require a 'suffix' key as an input parameter.

Title: Subtask Completion Report for Modify create_pair Endpoint

Checklist Details:
- **Verify_If_Condition_Updated**: Passed. The `if` condition for checking required keys in the `create_pair` endpoint in `/workspace/copilot-arena-server/app.py` has been updated to include `or "suffix" not in data`. (Reference: Task Agent's Observation 11, `stdout` content: `or "privacy" not in data or "suffix" not in data`).
- **Verify_Error_Message_Updated**: Passed. The error message for missing keys in the `create_pair` endpoint in `/workspace/copilot-arena-server/app.py` has been updated to `error_msg = "Request must contain keys: [prefix, userId, privacy, suffix]"`. (Reference: Task Agent's Observation 11, `stdout` content: `error_msg = "Request must contain keys: [prefix, userId, privacy, suffix]"`).

Conclusion: The Subtask "Modify create_pair Endpoint" is complete. Both verification checks passed, confirming that the `create_pair` endpoint has been successfully modified to require the 'suffix' key as an input parameter.

The current subtask has been successfully completed, and substantial new information has been obtained.  
Carefully review the updated context and determine how this new knowledge impacts the overall task progress.  
Design the next subtask to effectively leverage these insights and move closer to completing the full task.

Always remember that your ultimate goal is to complete task:
<task>
Find copilot arena's api server codebase in our gitlab (located at http://the-agent-company.com:8929/root/copilot-arena-server)
Pull this repository down to /workspace folder and then install the requirements.txt
Edit the create_pair endpoint so that it now requires the suffix key as an input
At the end, start the server in the background. To start the server, run the command:
uvicorn app:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 5000 --workers 1 --log-config log_conf.yaml&
</task>
75. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================
* The information you know and have obtained is:
    1. The target GitLab repository is `copilot-arena-server` at `http://the-agent-company.com:8929/root/copilot-arena-server`.
    2. The repository needs to be cloned into the `/workspace` folder.
    3. Python dependencies need to be installed from `requirements.txt`.
    4. The `create_pair` endpoint in the codebase must be modified to require a `suffix` key as an input parameter.
    5. The server needs to be started in the background using the command `uvicorn app:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 5000 --workers 1 --log-config log_conf.yaml&`.
    6. I have successfully logged into GitLab.
    7. I have successfully cloned the `copilot-arena-server` repository into `/workspace/copilot-arena-server`.
    8. All Python dependencies from `requirements.txt` have been successfully installed.
    9. The `create_pair` endpoint in `/workspace/copilot-arena-server/app.py` has been modified to require the `suffix` key as an input.

* The task can be divided into the following subtasks:
    1. Start Server: The 'copilot-arena-server' is running in the background on port 5000.

SubTask5: Start Server
Goal: The 'copilot-arena-server' is running in the background on port 5000.
77. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================
Thought: The current subtask is to start the server in the background. I will need to use the `run_cmd` tool to execute the `uvicorn` command. I should check if there are any relevant guides in the `System` application for executing shell commands.
Action:
<tool_call>

{'preconditions': 'The command to be executed is a valid shell command and the system has necessary binaries.

Analyze `stderr` for errors, `stdout` for output. `run_cmd` operates in isolated environments; `cd` does not persist across `run_cmd` calls. When using `subprocess`, use `check=True` to raise `CalledProcessError` on non-zero exit codes for robust error handling. `capture_output=True` is essential for getting stdout/stderr."}

After accessing, carefully read the guide content. Extract and adapt relevant steps, recognizing that guide information may be outdated or require UI verification. Always prioritize current browser state by performing `browser_wait_and_get_update()` immediately before attempting to follow guide steps.

79. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================
Thought: I have accessed the `ExecuteShellCommand` guide, which confirms that `run_cmd` can be used for executing shell commands. The task requires me to start the server in the background using the command `uvicorn app:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 5000 --workers 1 --log-config log_conf.yaml&`. I will execute this command within the `/workspace/copilot-arena-server` directory.
Action:
<tool_call>
{"name": "run_cmd", "arguments": {"command": "cd /workspace/copilot-arena-server && uvicorn app:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 5000 --workers 1 --log-config log_conf.yaml&"}}

{
  "execution_status": "TOOL_FAILURE_COMMAND_NOT_FOUND",
  "stderr": "❌ 命令执行失败: 系统中未找到 'cd' 这个命令。"
}
</tool_response>
<tool_instruction>
Always check `command_result.returncode`: `0` indicates success; non-zero suggests an error; analyze `command_result.stderr`. For successful commands, process `command_result.stdout`. *Note: `command_result.stderr` may contain non-error information; evaluate contextually.* **Crucially, for any sequence of shell commands or when integrating shell output with Python logic, *always encapsulate the entire interaction within a single Python script using `subprocess`* for maximum robustness and control, rather than relying on discrete `run_cmd` calls or shell features like redirection.**
</tool_instruction>

81. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================
Thought: The previous attempt to start the server failed because `cd` does not persist across `run_cmd` calls. As per the `tool_instruction`, for complex shell commands or when `cd` is required, it's best to use a Python script with `subprocess`. I will use `subprocess.Popen` to run the `uvicorn` command in the background, specifying the `cwd` to be `/workspace/copilot-arena-server`. This will ensure the command is executed from the correct directory.
Action:
<code>[SYSTEM INFO: History python code removed for brevity]</code>

Observation:

{
  "execution_status": "CODE_EXECUTED",

    "returncode": 0
  },
  "stdout": "Server started with PID: 323",
  "stderr": ""
}
</tool_response>
<tool_instruction>

</tool_instruction>

83. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================
Thought: The Python code successfully started the server in the background, as indicated by the `Server started with PID: 323` output and a `returncode` of 0. This directly fulfills the goal of the subtask, which is to have the 'copilot-arena-server' running in the background on port 5000.
Final Answer: The 'copilot-arena-server' is running in the background on port 5000.

Title: Subtask Completion Report for Start Server

Checklist Details:
- **CheckUvicornProcessIsRunning**: Passed. A `uvicorn` process, identified by PID `323` and running the command `/usr/local/bin/uvicorn app:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 5000 --workers 1 --log-config log_conf.yaml`, was actively found. (Reference: My Observation 2, `stdout` detailing the running process).
- **CheckPort5000IsOpen**: Passed. A programmatic check using Python's `socket` module confirmed that port 5000 is open and in a listening state on `127.0.0.1`. (Reference: My Observation 4, `stdout` stating "Port 5000 is open and listening.").

Conclusion: The Subtask "Start Server" is complete. Both verification checks passed, confirming that the 'copilot-arena-server' is running in the background on port 5000.

Please comprehensively review the entire task execution process, including all subtasks and the contextual information collected.  
Cross-check carefully against the overall task requirements:

1. **Completeness Check**: Ensure every aspect of the requirements has been addressed. Confirm that no items were skipped, postponed, or only partially completed.  
2. **Consistency Check**: Verify that all intermediate results are logically coherent and data-wise consistent with the final conclusions. There should be no contradictions, missing steps, or unexplained gaps.  
3. **Final Completion Confirmation**:  
   - If any requirements remain unfinished or results are insufficient, explicitly list the next subtasks to resolve them.  
   - If all requirements are fully and correctly met, return an empty task plan to indicate the task is completely finished.  

Always remember that your ultimate goal is to complete task:
<task>
Find copilot arena's api server codebase in our gitlab (located at http://the-agent-company.com:8929/root/copilot-arena-server)
Pull this repository down to /workspace folder and then install the requirements.txt
Edit the create_pair endpoint so that it now requires the suffix key as an input
At the end, start the server in the background. To start the server, run the command:
uvicorn app:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 5000 --workers 1 --log-config log_conf.yaml&
</task>
