</tools>

2. **Python Code Execution**
When executing Python code, please output:
<code>
... your code ...
</code>
- The working directory is `/workspace`
- Executing dangerous, destructive, or time-consuming code is prohibited.
- If both a **Tool Call** and **Python Code Execution** are included in the output, the tool call takes precedence, and the Python code will not be executed.
- Using outdated or limited python libraries may result in incomplete or inaccurate observations (e.g. missing images from PDFs or failing to extract key content). Always prefer robust, modern libraries to ensure full and reliable results.
- When performing file conversion or data extraction, always ensure **data integrity**. Verify that the structure, content, and critical fields of the source file are preserved in the output. Check row and column counts, headers, and key values before and after processing. **Avoid silent loss**, truncation, or unintended alteration of data.

## Action Execution Result Processing
- After each action is executed, an Observation is returned, which includes:
    1. `<tool_response>`: The result of the tool or code execution.
    2. `<tool_instruction>`: The instruction associated with a specific action, used to guide the next step or restrict subsequent behavior.
- **Note**: Do not fabricate observations.

## Security and Restrictions
- **Coding Actions (such as Python, CMD, etc.)**
    - Do not run high-risk operations that are large in code size or take a long time.
    - Do not execute code that could cause data loss, system damage, or irreversible changes.
    - Do not use the kill command with wildcards like * or other dangerous parameters that could result in a wide range of matches.
    - Prefer using the Python interpreter to execute code (safer and more efficient) rather than using the CMD tool.

> ⚠️ **Important**
> When your output contains content that fully conforms to the **Tool Call** or **Python Code Execution** format, the system will immediately parse, identify, and execute it as an **Action** without further confirmation and without reversal.
> Therefore, before outputting, always confirm that this is your **intended** action and fully assess the potential consequences and risks.
> If you are only using **quotes, demonstrations, or examples**, be sure to break the formatting or escape it to prevent the system from interpreting it as a real action.

# OBJECTIVE #
Your core objective is to independently and efficiently complete the tasks assigned to you by the company.


# MEMORY #
During previous tasks, you have accumulated the following reusable knowledge:

## Resolution Patterns
Comprehensive Contextualization: Systematically acquire and aggregate information from diverse, potentially unstructured sources, prioritizing local processing and cross-validation, to ensure a complete, coherent operational view and inform robust decisions.
Robust External Interaction: Prioritize stable, predictable interaction methods, such as structured APIs, and dynamically adapt strategies to ensure continuity and reliability with external systems despite their inconsistencies or volatility.
Adaptive Constraint Handling: When an objective is blocked by an unresolvable external constraint, acknowledge the limitation, perform necessary cleanup of partial artifacts, and adapt the strategy to proceed with viable data, avoiding unproductive retries.
Modular Resilient Design: Decompose operations into modular, decoupled units with explicit state management, to enhance predictability, isolate errors, improve maintainability, and ensure operational continuity.
Progressive Verification: Implement multi-stage validation, from granular checks within pipelines to comprehensive outcome validation, to localize errors, confirm system states, and ensure successful execution.

## Platform/Application Operation Guides
These guides summarize proven operation paths derived from past successful experiences.  
Each item is a structured reference designed to help you complete operations more quickly, accurately, and with reduced redundancy.

> This directory provides a comprehensive index of guides, compiling best practices and experience summaries for accomplishing various tasks.

### Recommended Usage Process
1. **Review the Guide First**  
   Before starting a task, browse the relevant entries in the directory to identify potentially useful guidance.  
2. **Targeted Access**  
   Use the `access_the_application_guide` tool to view detailed steps if necessary.  
3. **Reuse with Flexibility**  
   Apply past successful steps when they fit the current situation, but stay aware of possible mismatches.  
4. **Explore When Deviations Arise**  
   If the environment or results diverge from the guide, stop rigidly following it and explore alternative approaches through small, safe, and adaptive steps.

### Value of Guides
- Reduce task completion time by leveraging accumulated experience.  
- Lower error rates and avoid common pitfalls.  
- Ensure consistent, professional execution of tasks.  

### Guide Reliability & Adaptation
- Guides may be outdated, biased, or contain errors — they are “historical experience,” not absolute truth.  
- Use guides as starting points, not as strict rules.  
- When deviations or conflicts appear, **exit the guide and explore new paths** instead of persisting.  
- Record useful deviation points for later improvement of the guides.

SubTask1: Gather Sotopia Information
Goal: Obtain a concise introduction to Sotopia from the provided URL (http://the-agent-company.com:8929/root/sotopia) to be used on the second slide.
05. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================
Thought: The goal is to gather information about Sotopia from a given URL. I will use the `Browser` tool to navigate to the URL and then extract the relevant information.

Relevant `Platform/Application Operation Guide Directory` entries:
- `Browser`: `NavigateToURL`, `AnalyzePageContent`
Action:
<tool_call>
{"name": "access_the_application_guide", "arguments": {"application_name": "Browser", "item_names": ["NavigateToURL", "AnalyzePageContent"]}}
</tool_call>

06. | ================================================== USER MESSAGE ==================================================
Observation: 
<tool_response>
<Application name="Browser">
<NavigateToURL>
{'preconditions': 'A browser session is active.', 'steps': 'browser_go_to_url(url="<target_url>") -> browser_wait_and_get_update(seconds=3)', 'notes': 'Navigates the browser to a specific URL. Replace `<target_url>` with the desired URL. Successful navigation is verified by checking the current URL and the `webpage accessibility tree` content. This is a general guide applicable for any direct URL navigation.'}
</NavigateToURL>
<AnalyzePageContent>
{'preconditions': "The browser's accessibility tree has been updated with the current page content (e.g., using `Browser: WaitForPageUpdate`).", 'steps': "Analyze the `webpage accessibility tree` (e.g., specific element types like 'listitem', 'paragraph', 'link', 'heading', 'textbox') to identify and extract relevant text content or element properties.", 'notes': 'Requires careful parsing of the accessibility tree based on the expected page structure. Manual inspection is often necessary to pinpoint the desired data. This guide describes an analytical step and does not modify the page.'}
</AnalyzePageContent>
</Application>
</tool_response>
<tool_instruction>
After accessing, carefully read the guide content. Extract and adapt relevant steps, recognizing that guide information may be outdated or require UI verification. Always prioritize current browser state by performing `browser_wait_and_get_update()` immediately before attempting to follow guide steps.
</tool_instruction>

07. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================
Thought: I have accessed the guides for `NavigateToURL` and `AnalyzePageContent`. Now I need to navigate to the specified URL and then extract the content. I will use `browser_go_to_url` to go to the Sotopia page, then `browser_wait_and_get_update` to ensure the page is loaded, and finally `browser_extract_content_by_vision` to get the introduction to Sotopia.
Action:
<tool_call>
{"name": "browser_go_to_url", "arguments": {"url": "http://the-agent-company.com:8929/root/sotopia"}}
</tool_call>
08. | ================================================== USER MESSAGE ==================================================
Observation: 
<tool_response>
Performed browser action: 🔗 Navigated to http://the-agent-company.com:8929/root/sotopia
The updated browser page status is as follows:
<webpage accessibility tree>[SYSTEM INFO: History accessibility tree removed for brevity]</webpage accessibility tree>
<webpage interactive elements>[SYSTEM INFO: History interactive elements removed for brevity]</webpage interactive elements>

</tool_response>
<tool_instruction>
Always inspect the `webpage accessibility tree` and `webpage interactive elements` after navigation to confirm the page loaded as expected. This step is crucial for verifying successful navigation and for preparing for subsequent interactions by ensuring the browser state is as anticipated.
</tool_instruction>

09. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================
Thought: The page has loaded successfully, and I can see the "Introduction" section with a description of Sotopia. I will now use `browser_extract_content_by_vision` to extract the relevant text for the introduction to Sotopia.
Action:
<tool_call>
{"name": "browser_extract_content_by_vision", "arguments": {"query": "Extract the text from the 'Introduction' section, starting from the heading 'Introduction' and including the paragraph below it."}}
</tool_call>
10. | ================================================== USER MESSAGE ==================================================
Observation: 
<tool_response>
Performed browser action: Based on the image provided, the section that serves as the introduction is labeled 'Project information'. Here is the extracted text from that section:

**Project information**
Sotopia: an Open-ended Social Learning Environment (ICLR 2024 spotlight)
The updated browser page status is as follows:
<webpage accessibility tree>[SYSTEM INFO: History accessibility tree removed for brevity]</webpage accessibility tree>
<webpage interactive elements>[SYSTEM INFO: History interactive elements removed for brevity]</webpage interactive elements>

</tool_response>
<tool_instruction>
After extracting content by vision, carefully review the output for accuracy and completeness. Be aware that visual models may misinterpret or omit information, and always cross-verify critical data with accessible elements if possible. **If the desired content is not found, ensure it is within the current browser viewport by scrolling or navigating to the correct page.**
</tool_instruction>

11. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================
Thought: The previous attempt to extract the introduction was not precise enough, as it extracted from "Project information" instead of "Introduction". I need to be more specific in my query to `browser_extract_content_by_vision`. I will try again, explicitly asking for the text under the "Introduction" heading.
Action:
<tool_call>
{"name": "browser_extract_content_by_vision", "arguments": {"query": "Extract the paragraph text that immediately follows the 'Introduction' heading (level 2)."}}
</tool_call>
12. | ================================================== USER MESSAGE ==================================================
Observation: 
<tool_response>
Performed browser action: Based on the image provided, there is no heading explicitly labeled "Introduction". However, there is a "Project information" section which serves a similar purpose. The text that immediately follows this heading is:

Sotopia: an Open-ended Social Learning Environment (ICLR 2024 spotlight)
The updated browser page status is as follows:
<webpage accessibility tree>[SYSTEM INFO: History accessibility tree removed for brevity]</webpage accessibility tree>
<webpage interactive elements>[SYSTEM INFO: History interactive elements removed for brevity]</webpage interactive elements>

</tool_response>

After extracting content by vision, carefully review the output for accuracy and completeness. Be aware that visual models may misinterpret or omit information, and always cross-verify critical data with accessible elements if possible. **If the desired content is not found, ensure it is within the current browser viewport by scrolling or navigating to the correct page.**

13. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================
Thought: The `browser_extract_content_by_vision` tool failed to accurately extract the "Introduction" section. The tool's instruction suggests that visual models may misinterpret information and that I should cross-verify with accessible elements if possible. I have already verified that the "Introduction" heading and its corresponding paragraph are present in the `webpage accessibility tree`. Therefore, I will use Python code to parse the `webpage accessibility tree` and extract the required information.

First, I will convert the `webpage accessibility tree` into a string that can be processed by Python. Then I will look for the "Introduction" heading and extract the text from the following paragraph.

SubTask2: Define Social Tasks for Openhands
Goal: Brainstorm and list at least 3-5 distinct social tasks that an Openhands agent could be tested on.
21. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================
Thought: The goal of this subtask is to brainstorm and list 3-5 distinct social tasks for an Openhands agent. This is a creative task that doesn't directly involve tool usage for execution. I will use my own reasoning and understanding of "social tasks" and "Openhands agents" to generate this list. Therefore, there are no specific `Platform/Application Operation Guide Directory` entries that would be directly helpful for *generating* the ideas. I will simply list the tasks in my `Final Answer`.

1.  **Negotiation/Bargaining**: Agents could negotiate prices for goods or services, or terms of a contract, with other agents or human users. This involves understanding value, making concessions, and reaching mutually beneficial agreements.
2.  **Collaborative Problem Solving**: Agents could work together to solve a complex problem that requires multiple perspectives or skill sets. This would involve communication, task division, and conflict resolution.
3.  **Social Persuasion/Influence**: Agents could attempt to persuade other agents or users to adopt a certain viewpoint, take a specific action, or change their behavior. This would involve understanding social dynamics, rhetoric, and emotional intelligence.
4.  **Role-Playing/Scenario Simulation**: Agents could participate in simulated social scenarios (e.g., a customer service interaction, a team meeting, a debate) where they need to adapt their behavior to a specific role and interact appropriately.
5.  **Conflict Resolution/Mediation**: Agents could act as mediators between two conflicting parties (agents or humans), helping them to understand each other's perspectives and find common ground.
Final Answer:
1.  **Negotiation/Bargaining**: Agents engage in discussions to reach mutually agreeable terms for resources, tasks, or information, demonstrating understanding of value and compromise.
2.  **Collaborative Problem Solving**: Agents work together to achieve a shared goal, requiring communication, task delegation, and synthesis of individual contributions.
3.  **Social Persuasion/Influence**: Agents attempt to convince others to adopt a particular viewpoint or take a specific action, utilizing rhetorical strategies and understanding of social dynamics.
4.  **Role-Playing/Scenario Simulation**: Agents participate in simulated social contexts, adapting their behavior and communication style to fit a given role (e.g., customer service, team lead, interviewee).
5.  **Conflict Resolution/Mediation**: Agents facilitate discussions between conflicting parties, aiming to de-escalate tensions, identify common ground, and propose resolutions.

    1. The goal is to create a slide deck (`.pptx` file) to pitch the idea of integrating Sotopia into Openhands and supporting social tasks.
    2. The final slide deck must be saved at `/workspace/pitch.pptx`.
    3. The first page of the slide deck must be titled "Idea: Integrate Sotopia into Openhands".
    4. The second page needs a short introduction to Sotopia, referencing the URL `http://the-agent-company.com:8929/root/sotopia`.
    5. The third page must be titled "Social Tasks" and include a list of social tasks for Openhands agents.
    6. The fourth page must be titled "Q&A".
    7. I can add additional pages or visual presentations to make the pitch more compelling.
    8. The introduction to Sotopia for the second slide is: "Sotopia is an open-ended social learning environment that allows agents to interact with each other and the environment. The environment is designed to be a platform for evaluating and faciliating social intelligence in language agents. The environment is designed to be open-ended, meaning that the environment can be easily extended to include new environments and new agents. The environment is also designed to be scalable, meaning that the environment can be easily scaled to include a large number of agents and environments."
    9. The list of social tasks for the third slide includes:
        *   **Negotiation/Bargaining**: Agents engage in discussions to reach mutually agreeable terms for resources, tasks, or information, demonstrating understanding of value and compromise.
        *   **Collaborative Problem Solving**: Agents work together to achieve a shared goal, requiring communication, task delegation, and synthesis of individual contributions.
        *   **Social Persuasion/Influence**: Agents attempt to convince others to adopt a particular viewpoint or take a specific action, utilizing rhetorical strategies and understanding of social dynamics.
        *   **Role-Playing/Scenario Simulation**: Agents participate in simulated social contexts, adapting their behavior and communication style to fit a given role (e.g., customer service, team lead, interviewee).
        *   **Conflict Resolution/Mediation**: Agents facilitate discussions between conflicting parties, aiming to de-escalate tensions, identify common ground, and propose resolutions.
    10. The `python-pptx` library is confirmed to be installed and importable.
    11. The slide deck was successfully created with 4 slides, including the specified titles and content, and saved to `/workspace/pitch.pptx`.

* The task can be divided into the following subtasks:
