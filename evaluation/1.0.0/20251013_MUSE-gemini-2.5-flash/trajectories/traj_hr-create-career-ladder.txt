# ACTION #
During task execution, you can perform **Actions**, including:
1. **Tool Call**
2. **Python Code Execution**

## Action Output Format
1. **Tool Call**
When calling a tool, please output:
<tool_call>
{"name": "<function-name>", "arguments": <args-json-object>}
</tool_call>
- `<function-name>`: Tool function name
- `<args-json-object>`: Call arguments (JSON format)
- If multiple `<tool_call>` are output at once, only the first one will be executed; the rest will be ignored.

Available tool signatures are provided within the `<tools>` tag:
<tools>
{"type": "function", "function": {"name": "extract_image_content_by_gpt4o", "description": "Utilizes `gpt-4o` to interpret and extract content from local image files (e.g., PNG, JPEG). Highly effective for **scanned documents, image-based PDFs (post-conversion to image formats),** or visual data. For optimal extraction, craft precise queries. **Caution: While effective for general content, direct numerical or highly structured extraction from complex visual elements (e.g., tally marks, handwritten notes) may be imprecise; robust post-processing is often required. For multi-page documents, convert each page into a separate image and ensure *all* generated image pages are processed for complete data extraction.**", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"image_path": {"type": "string", "description": "Local image path."}, "query": {"type": "string", "description": "Query to the gpt-4o to get the image content."}}, "required": ["image_path", "query"]}}}

Element indices are dynamic and highly volatile; always verify the target element's existence and index using `browser_wait_and_get_update` immediately before clicking. Be aware that even with immediate updates, indices can shift in very dynamic UIs. Crucially, after clicking, always use `browser_wait_and_get_update` to immediately re-evaluate the page state and confirm the intended effect (e.g., UI changes, navigation). For navigation, `browser_go_to_url` is a more robust alternative when a direct URL is known. For form submissions or general action triggers, `browser_send_keys` with 'Enter' is often a more robust alternative, especially when direct clicking by index proves unreliable. Avoid clicking elements that are not currently visible or interactable.", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"index": {"type": "integer", "description": "The index number of the target element."}}, "required": ["index"]}}}

It cannot process content that is scrolled out of view or exists on other pages of a paginated list. While `accessibility tree` and `interactive elements` are primary for UI understanding, this visual tool can be a highly effective *primary* method for text extraction in challenging scenarios. **Crucially, for critical or structured data (e.g., IDs, specific names, numerical values), always cross-verify with or prefer extraction from the `webpage accessibility tree` as visual interpretation may introduce inaccuracies, especially for abbreviated or visually ambiguous elements.**", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"query": {"type": "string", "description": "Query to the VL model to get the browser page content."}}, "required": ["query"]}}}

The `webpage interactive elements` from its output are highly dynamic and should be used immediately. For verifying responses or dynamic updates, consider setting `seconds` to a value appropriate for expected latency (e.g., `seconds=1` for immediate state, longer for human-like response times). **This tool is a fundamental prerequisite for almost all subsequent browser interactions due to the highly dynamic nature of web UI element indices.**", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"seconds": {"type": "integer", "description": "The number of seconds to wait, the default is 3 seconds.", "default": 3}}, "required": []}}}

Returns a JSON object with `execution_status`, `returncode`, `stdout`, and `stderr`. **Important Precautions**: 1) `returncode=0` does not guarantee successful side effects (e.g., file creation); always verify with independent checks (`ls -l`, `file`). 2) **This tool executes commands in a *minimal* shell environment. Complex shell features like command chaining (`&&`, `||`), pipes (`|`), I/O redirection (`>`, `>>`), and backgrounding (`&`) are often *not reliably interpreted by `run_cmd` directly* and can lead to unexpected behavior or errors (e.g., `SyntaxError`, `command not found`). For any non-trivial shell interaction or complex logic, *always prefer consolidating operations into a single Python script that uses `subprocess` for explicit control and robustness* over multiple `run_cmd` calls or complex shell syntax.** 3) Quote arguments containing spaces (`\"path with spaces\"`). 4) State changes (`cd`) do not persist across calls.", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"command": {"type": "string", "description": "command暂时没有参数描述"}}, "required": ["command"]}}}
</tools>

2. **Python Code Execution**
When executing Python code, please output:
<code>
... your code ...
</code>
- The working directory is `/workspace`
- Executing dangerous, destructive, or time-consuming code is prohibited.
- If both a **Tool Call** and **Python Code Execution** are included in the output, the tool call takes precedence, and the Python code will not be executed.
- Using outdated or limited python libraries may result in incomplete or inaccurate observations (e.g. missing images from PDFs or failing to extract key content). Always prefer robust, modern libraries to ensure full and reliable results.
- When performing file conversion or data extraction, always ensure **data integrity**. Verify that the structure, content, and critical fields of the source file are preserved in the output. Check row and column counts, headers, and key values before and after processing. **Avoid silent loss**, truncation, or unintended alteration of data.

## Action Execution Result Processing
- After each action is executed, an Observation is returned, which includes:
    1. `<tool_response>`: The result of the tool or code execution.
    2. `<tool_instruction>`: The instruction associated with a specific action, used to guide the next step or restrict subsequent behavior.
- **Note**: Do not fabricate observations.

## Security and Restrictions
- **Coding Actions (such as Python, CMD, etc.)**
    - Do not run high-risk operations that are large in code size or take a long time.
    - Do not execute code that could cause data loss, system damage, or irreversible changes.
    - Do not use the kill command with wildcards like * or other dangerous parameters that could result in a wide range of matches.
    - Prefer using the Python interpreter to execute code (safer and more efficient) rather than using the CMD tool.

> ⚠️ **Important**
> When your output contains content that fully conforms to the **Tool Call** or **Python Code Execution** format, the system will immediately parse, identify, and execute it as an **Action** without further confirmation and without reversal.
> Therefore, before outputting, always confirm that this is your **intended** action and fully assess the potential consequences and risks.
> If you are only using **quotes, demonstrations, or examples**, be sure to break the formatting or escape it to prevent the system from interpreting it as a real action.

# OBJECTIVE #
Your core objective is to independently and efficiently complete the tasks assigned to you by the company.


# MEMORY #
During previous tasks, you have accumulated the following reusable knowledge:

## Resolution Patterns
Comprehensive Contextualization: Systematically acquire and aggregate information from diverse, potentially unstructured sources, prioritizing local processing and cross-validation, to ensure a complete, coherent operational view and inform robust decisions.
Robust External Interaction: Prioritize stable, predictable interaction methods, such as structured APIs, and dynamically adapt strategies to ensure continuity and reliability with external systems despite their inconsistencies or volatility.
Adaptive Constraint Handling: When an objective is blocked by an unresolvable external constraint, acknowledge the limitation, perform necessary cleanup of partial artifacts, and adapt the strategy to proceed with viable data, avoiding unproductive retries.
Modular Resilient Design: Decompose operations into modular, decoupled units with explicit state management, to enhance predictability, isolate errors, improve maintainability, and ensure operational continuity.
Progressive Verification: Implement multi-stage validation, from granular checks within pipelines to comprehensive outcome validation, to localize errors, confirm system states, and ensure successful execution.

## Platform/Application Operation Guides
These guides summarize proven operation paths derived from past successful experiences.  
Each item is a structured reference designed to help you complete operations more quickly, accurately, and with reduced redundancy.

> This directory provides a comprehensive index of guides, compiling best practices and experience summaries for accomplishing various tasks.

### Recommended Usage Process
1. **Review the Guide First**  
   Before starting a task, browse the relevant entries in the directory to identify potentially useful guidance.  
2. **Targeted Access**  
   Use the `access_the_application_guide` tool to view detailed steps if necessary.  
3. **Reuse with Flexibility**  
   Apply past successful steps when they fit the current situation, but stay aware of possible mismatches.  
4. **Explore When Deviations Arise**  
   If the environment or results diverge from the guide, stop rigidly following it and explore alternative approaches through small, safe, and adaptive steps.

### Value of Guides
- Reduce task completion time by leveraging accumulated experience.  
- Lower error rates and avoid common pitfalls.  
- Ensure consistent, professional execution of tasks.  

### Guide Reliability & Adaptation
- Guides may be outdated, biased, or contain errors — they are “historical experience,” not absolute truth.  
- Use guides as starting points, not as strict rules.  
- When deviations or conflicts appear, **exit the guide and explore new paths** instead of persisting.  
- Record useful deviation points for later improvement of the guides.

After inputting text, always use `browser_wait_and_get_update` to verify the text input, check for immediate validation feedback, or confirm any UI changes (e.g., enable/disable buttons, form submission readiness).

If an `Element index does not exist` error is returned, it indicates extreme element volatility. **Always re-evaluate `webpage interactive elements` with `browser_wait_and_get_update` immediately before attempting a click, and crucially, confirm the element's `text` or `aria-label` attribute semantically matches the intended target.** If direct clicking by index proves unreliable, *especially within dynamic lists or sidebars (e.g., chat contact lists)*, consider alternative strategies like using an application's built-in search functionality or `browser_go_to_url` if a direct link is known, rather than repeatedly retrying. For form submissions or general action triggers, `browser_send_keys` with 'Enter' is a more robust alternative and **highly recommended for reliability**.

Title: Subtask Completion Report: Login to OwnCloud

Checklist Details:
- **Check 1: `verify_current_url`**: **PASSED**. The browser's URL after the login attempt was `http://the-agent-company.com:8092/index.php/apps/files/?dir=%2F&fileid=5`, which is consistent with a successful OwnCloud login to the files management page, as noted in Observation 11 and aligned with the guide's expectation.
- **Check 2: `verify_absence_of_login_form`**: **PASSED**. After the login action, the interactive elements representing the username/password input fields and the login button were no longer present in the `webpage interactive elements` (Observation 11), confirming a successful transition past the login screen.
- **Check 3: `verify_presence_of_file_management_elements`**: **PASSED**. The current page displayed clear indicators of a successful login to the file management interface, including the page title "Files - ownCloud", a prominent "Files" heading, and links such as "All files" and "Documents" (Observation 11).

Conclusion:
The Subtask "Login to OwnCloud" is **complete**. The Task Agent successfully navigated to OwnCloud, provided credentials, logged in, and landed on the expected file management interface, as verified by URL, absence of login form, and presence of file management elements.

Thought: The previous attempt to install `odt2txt` failed because `sudo` command was not found. This indicates that I don't have root privileges or `sudo` is not configured in this environment. I need an alternative way to convert the ODT file.

Since direct installation using `apt-get` with `sudo` is not possible, I will explore Python libraries that can handle ODT files. A common library for this is `python-docx` for `.docx` files, but for `.odt` files, I might need `odfpy` or similar. I'll try to find a Python library that can convert ODT to text. If a direct conversion library isn't readily available or installable, I might have to consider an alternative approach, such as trying to read the ODT file as a zip archive and extract the content.

First, I will try to install `odfpy` using `pip`, as `pip` installations usually don't require `sudo`.

Thought: For Subtask 4: Extract Employee Data, I need to read the `Personnell_File.txt` and extract structured data. I will look for guides in the `System` application related to reading files and processing data. Specifically, `ReadFile` and `ProcessAndFormatStringData` seem relevant.

Thought: I have the `ReadFile` and `ProcessAndFormatStringData` guides. The `ReadFile` guide tells me how to read the content of `Personnell_File.txt`. The `ProcessAndFormatStringData` guide is generic but confirms that I should use Python to parse the data.

My plan is:
1. Read the content of `Personnell_File.txt` using `run_cmd` with `cat`.
2. Use Python to parse the text content. I will need to define a parsing logic based on the expected format of the `Personnell_File.txt`. From the previous `spot_check_content_readability` check, I know it starts with "1. Sarah Johnson (Female, 42 years old)". I will assume a structured format that I can parse line by line using regular expressions or string splitting. I need to extract name, age, gender, position, department, and years of experience. I will store this information in a list of dictionaries for easy manipulation.

Thought: I have successfully retrieved the content of `Personnell_File.txt`. Now I need to parse this text to extract structured employee data. The data is presented in a consistent format, with each employee entry starting with a numbered line containing name, gender, and age, followed by indented lines for role, responsibilities, skills (optional), project, and slack channels.

I will write a Python script to:
1. Split the entire text into individual employee blocks.
2. For each block, use regular expressions to extract the employee's name, gender, and age from the first line.
3. Parse the subsequent lines to extract the "Role", "Responsibilities", "Skills", "Project", and "Slack Channels". I will pay attention to the optional "Skills" field and handle cases where it might be missing.
4. Store the extracted information in a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents an employee. I will also try to infer the department based on the role or project if a clear department field is not present.

This parsing will complete the "Extract Employee Data" subtask.

<task>
Navigate to owncloud at http://the-agent-company.com:8092. Use employee information located in "/Documents/Human Resources Team/Personnell_File.odt" to create a career ladder for TheAgentCompany. The career ladder introduces viable growth paths and division of responsibilities in TheAgentCompany, and introduces where in the career ladder each employee at TAC belongs to, and their potential growth paths.
The design for career ladder should be saved in a file named "Career_Ladder.odt" under "/Documents/Human Resources Team". Navigate to RocketChat at http://the-agent-company.com:3000/home. Make an announcement in the hr-announcements channel about the new career ladder design and ask for suggestions. This career ladder is a draft with room for creativity. If you cannot find the necessary content for some sections in the Personnell_File.odt document, please feel free to suggest them in the manual.

This JSON file contains a list of dictionaries, each representing an employee with their name, gender, age, role, responsibilities, skills, project, slack channels, and an inferred department.

* The task can be divided into the following subtasks:
    1. Draft Career Ladder Content: Generate the comprehensive content for the 'Career_Ladder.odt', detailing viable growth paths, division of responsibilities, and explicitly mapping each employee's current position and potential growth paths within TheAgentCompany, including suggestions for any missing information. This will be an intermediate text representation of the career ladder.

SubTask5: Draft Career Ladder Content
Goal: Generate the comprehensive content for the 'Career_Ladder.odt', detailing viable growth paths, division of responsibilities, and explicitly mapping each employee's current position and potential growth paths within TheAgentCompany, including suggestions for any missing information. This will be an intermediate text representation of the career ladder.
63. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================
Thought: For Subtask 5: Draft Career Ladder Content, I will leverage the `extracted_employee_data.json` file. I will use Python to load this data, define a generic career ladder structure, assign employees to this structure, and then generate a comprehensive text output that details the career ladder, division of responsibilities, and individual employee placements and potential growth paths. I don't foresee needing to access any specific application guides for this content generation, as it's primarily a data processing and text formatting task within Python.

I will use the following `Platform/Application Operation Guide Directory` entries as general reference for data processing if needed, though the primary work will be in Python:
- `System: ProcessAndFormatStringData`
- `System: ReadFile` (to read the JSON data)

Since I have already read the JSON data in the previous step and confirmed its structure, I will proceed directly to the Python code for drafting the career ladder content.

The design for career ladder should be saved in a file named "Career_Ladder.odt" under "/Documents/Human Resources Team". Navigate to RocketChat at http://the-agent-company.com:3000/home. Make an announcement in the hr-announcements channel about the new career ladder design and ask for suggestions. This career ladder is a draft with room for creativity. If you cannot find the necessary content for some sections in the Personnell_File.odt document, please feel free to suggest them in the manual.

Title: Subtask Completion Report: Login to RocketChat

Checklist Details:
- **Check 1: `verify_current_url`**: **PASSED**. The browser's URL after the login attempt was `http://the-agent-company.com:3000/home` (Observation 11), which is consistent with a successful RocketChat login to the home page, as noted in the login guide's expectation.
- **Check 2: `verify_absence_of_login_form`**: **PASSED**. After the login action, the interactive elements representing the username/password input fields and the login button were no longer present in the `webpage interactive elements` (Observation 11), confirming a successful transition past the login screen. These elements were clearly visible in Observation 5 before the login.
- **Check 3: `verify_presence_of_dashboard_elements`**: **PASSED**. The `webpage accessibility tree` in Observation 11 clearly showed RocketChat dashboard elements such as "Home", "Search", "Directory" buttons, and channel lists (e.g., "general", "kudos"), signifying a successful login and the display of the expected user interface.

Conclusion:
The Subtask "Login to RocketChat" is **complete**. The Task Agent successfully navigated to RocketChat, provided credentials, logged in, and landed on the expected dashboard interface, as verified by the current URL, the absence of the login form, and the presence of key dashboard elements.

<task>
Navigate to owncloud at http://the-agent-company.com:8092. Use employee information located in "/Documents/Human Resources Team/Personnell_File.odt" to create a career ladder for TheAgentCompany. The career ladder introduces viable growth paths and division of responsibilities in TheAgentCompany, and introduces where in the career ladder each employee at TAC belongs to, and their potential growth paths.
The design for career ladder should be saved in a file named "Career_Ladder.odt" under "/Documents/Human Resources Team". Navigate to RocketChat at http://the-agent-company.com:3000/home. Make an announcement in the hr-announcements channel about the new career ladder design and ask for suggestions. This career ladder is a draft with room for creativity. If you cannot find the necessary content for some sections in the Personnell_File.odt document, please feel free to suggest them in the manual.
