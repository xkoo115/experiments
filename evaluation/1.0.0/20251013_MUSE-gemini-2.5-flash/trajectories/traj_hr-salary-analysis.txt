The `webpage interactive elements` from its output are highly dynamic and should be used immediately. For verifying responses or dynamic updates, consider setting `seconds` to a value appropriate for expected latency (e.g., `seconds=1` for immediate state, longer for human-like response times). **This tool is a fundamental prerequisite for almost all subsequent browser interactions due to the highly dynamic nature of web UI element indices.**", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"seconds": {"type": "integer", "description": "The number of seconds to wait, the default is 3 seconds.", "default": 3}}, "required": []}}}

Returns a JSON object with `execution_status`, `returncode`, `stdout`, and `stderr`. **Important Precautions**: 1) `returncode=0` does not guarantee successful side effects (e.g., file creation); always verify with independent checks (`ls -l`, `file`). 2) **This tool executes commands in a *minimal* shell environment. Complex shell features like command chaining (`&&`, `||`), pipes (`|`), I/O redirection (`>`, `>>`), and backgrounding (`&`) are often *not reliably interpreted by `run_cmd` directly* and can lead to unexpected behavior or errors (e.g., `SyntaxError`, `command not found`). For any non-trivial shell interaction or complex logic, *always prefer consolidating operations into a single Python script that uses `subprocess` for explicit control and robustness* over multiple `run_cmd` calls or complex shell syntax.** 3) Quote arguments containing spaces (`\"path with spaces\"`). 4) State changes (`cd`) do not persist across calls.", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"command": {"type": "string", "description": "shell command string."}}, "required": ["command"]}}}
</tools>

2. **Python Code Execution**
When executing Python code, please output:
<code>
... your code ...
</code>
- The working directory is `/workspace`
- Executing dangerous, destructive, or time-consuming code is prohibited.
- If both a **Tool Call** and **Python Code Execution** are included in the output, the tool call takes precedence, and the Python code will not be executed.
- Using outdated or limited python libraries may result in incomplete or inaccurate observations (e.g. missing images from PDFs or failing to extract key content). Always prefer robust, modern libraries to ensure full and reliable results.
- When performing file conversion or data extraction, always ensure **data integrity**. Verify that the structure, content, and critical fields of the source file are preserved in the output. Check row and column counts, headers, and key values before and after processing. **Avoid silent loss**, truncation, or unintended alteration of data.

## Action Execution Result Processing
- After each action is executed, an Observation is returned, which includes:
    1. `<tool_response>`: The result of the tool or code execution.
    2. `<tool_instruction>`: The instruction associated with a specific action, used to guide the next step or restrict subsequent behavior.
- **Note**: Do not fabricate observations.

## Security and Restrictions
- **Coding Actions (such as Python, CMD, etc.)**
    - Do not run high-risk operations that are large in code size or take a long time.
    - Do not execute code that could cause data loss, system damage, or irreversible changes.
    - Do not use the kill command with wildcards like * or other dangerous parameters that could result in a wide range of matches.
    - Prefer using the Python interpreter to execute code (safer and more efficient) rather than using the CMD tool.

> ⚠️ **Important**
> When your output contains content that fully conforms to the **Tool Call** or **Python Code Execution** format, the system will immediately parse, identify, and execute it as an **Action** without further confirmation and without reversal.
> Therefore, before outputting, always confirm that this is your **intended** action and fully assess the potential consequences and risks.
> If you are only using **quotes, demonstrations, or examples**, be sure to break the formatting or escape it to prevent the system from interpreting it as a real action.

# OBJECTIVE #
Your core objective is to independently and efficiently complete the tasks assigned to you by the company.


# MEMORY #
During previous tasks, you have accumulated the following reusable knowledge:

## Resolution Patterns
Comprehensive Contextualization: Systematically acquire and aggregate information from diverse, potentially unstructured sources, prioritizing local processing and cross-validation, to ensure a complete, coherent operational view and inform robust decisions.
Robust External Interaction: Prioritize stable, predictable interaction methods, such as structured APIs, and dynamically adapt strategies to ensure continuity and reliability with external systems despite their inconsistencies or volatility.
Adaptive Constraint Handling: When an objective is blocked by an unresolvable external constraint, acknowledge the limitation, perform necessary cleanup of partial artifacts, and adapt the strategy to proceed with viable data, avoiding unproductive retries.
Modular Resilient Design: Decompose operations into modular, decoupled units with explicit state management, to enhance predictability, isolate errors, improve maintainability, and ensure operational continuity.
Progressive Verification: Implement multi-stage validation, from granular checks within pipelines to comprehensive outcome validation, to localize errors, confirm system states, and ensure successful execution.

## Platform/Application Operation Guides
These guides summarize proven operation paths derived from past successful experiences.  
Each item is a structured reference designed to help you complete operations more quickly, accurately, and with reduced redundancy.

> This directory provides a comprehensive index of guides, compiling best practices and experience summaries for accomplishing various tasks.

### Recommended Usage Process
1. **Review the Guide First**  
   Before starting a task, browse the relevant entries in the directory to identify potentially useful guidance.  
2. **Targeted Access**  
   Use the `access_the_application_guide` tool to view detailed steps if necessary.  
3. **Reuse with Flexibility**  
   Apply past successful steps when they fit the current situation, but stay aware of possible mismatches.  
4. **Explore When Deviations Arise**  
   If the environment or results diverge from the guide, stop rigidly following it and explore alternative approaches through small, safe, and adaptive steps.

### Value of Guides
- Reduce task completion time by leveraging accumulated experience.  
- Lower error rates and avoid common pitfalls.  
- Ensure consistent, professional execution of tasks.  

### Guide Reliability & Adaptation
- Guides may be outdated, biased, or contain errors — they are “historical experience,” not absolute truth.  
- Use guides as starting points, not as strict rules.  
- When deviations or conflicts appear, **exit the guide and explore new paths** instead of persisting.  
- Record useful deviation points for later improvement of the guides.

If an `Element index does not exist` error is returned, it indicates extreme element volatility. **Always re-evaluate `webpage interactive elements` with `browser_wait_and_get_update` immediately before attempting a click, and crucially, confirm the element's `text` or `aria-label` attribute semantically matches the intended target.** If direct clicking by index proves unreliable, *especially within dynamic lists or sidebars (e.g., chat contact lists)*, consider alternative strategies like using an application's built-in search functionality or `browser_go_to_url` if a direct link is known, rather than repeatedly retrying. For form submissions or general action triggers, `browser_send_keys` with 'Enter' is a more robust alternative and **highly recommended for reliability**.

Title: Subtask Completion Verification for "Login to OwnCloud"

Checklist Details:
- **Verify OwnCloud Login Status**:
    - **Expected URL**: The URL should indicate successful access to the OwnCloud file management interface (e.g., `http://the-agent-company.com:8092/index.php/apps/files/...`).
        - **Actual Result (Observation from step 17)**: The `RootWebArea` in the `webpage accessibility tree` shows the URL as `http://the-agent-company.com:8092/index.php/apps/files/?dir=%2F&fileid=5`, which matches the expected pattern for the OwnCloud file management interface.
    - **Absence of Login Elements**: Login form components (username and password input fields, login button) should no longer be present on the page.
        - **Actual Result (Observation from step 17)**: The `webpage interactive elements` list does not contain any input fields with placeholders like "Username or email" or "Password", nor a submit button titled "Log in". This confirms the login elements are no longer visible.

Conclusion:
Based on the verification steps, the Subtask "Login to OwnCloud" is **complete**. The browser is successfully logged into OwnCloud, evident by the current URL pointing to the file management interface and the absence of login form elements on the page, aligning with the Task Agent's stated completion.

Thought: I have successfully read the content of `salary.txt`. The data is in a CSV-like format, but the header `Name,Salary,Email` does not perfectly match the data rows, which contain four fields: `Name`, `Role`, `Salary`, `Email`. I will use Python with the `pandas` library to parse this data correctly.

First, I need to ensure `pandas` is installed. I will attempt to import it, and if it fails, I will install it. Then, I will parse the data, assign the correct column names, convert the 'Salary' column to a numeric type, and perform the required statistical analysis.

Here's the Python code I'll execute:
1. Try to import pandas. If it fails, install it.
2. Read the `stdout` string into a pandas DataFrame, explicitly setting column names.
3. Convert the 'Salary' column to numeric.
4. Calculate average salary by role, highest salary, lowest salary, and median salaries across roles.
5. Print the results in a structured format.

Title: Subtask Completion Verification for "Analyze salary data"

Checklist Details:
-   **Verify all required metrics are present in the report:**
    -   **Expected**: The Python script's output should contain 'Average Salary by Role', 'Highest Salary', 'Lowest Salary', and 'Median Salaries by Role'.
    -   **Actual Result (Observation from step 07)**: The `stdout` clearly shows all these keys: `'Average Salary by Role'`, `'Highest Salary'`, `'Lowest Salary'`, and `'Median Salaries by Role'`. This confirms all required metrics were calculated and reported.
-   **Verify salary data parsing and column assignment:**
    -   **Expected**: The Python code should correctly parse 'Role' and 'Salary' columns from `salary.txt`, accounting for the initial header discrepancy.
    -   **Actual Result (Observation from step 06)**: The Python code explicitly handles the header by skipping the first line (`salary_data_str.splitlines()[1:]`) and then assigning correct names (`names=['Name', 'Role', 'Salary', 'Email']`) during `pd.read_csv`. The code then correctly uses `df.groupby('Role')['Salary']` for calculations, confirming accurate parsing and assignment.
-   **Spot-check 'Highest Salary' calculation:**
    -   **Expected**: The 'Highest Salary' reported by the script should match the highest salary in the raw data.
    -   **Actual Result (Observation from step 05 & 07)**: The raw `salary.txt` (stdout from step 05) contains salaries including 95000. The Python script's output (stdout from step 07) reports `'Highest Salary': np.int64(95000)`. Both values match, confirming calculation accuracy.

Conclusion:
Based on the verification steps, the Subtask "Analyze salary data" is **complete**. The Task Agent successfully read the `salary.txt` file, correctly parsed the data despite header inconsistencies, and accurately calculated and reported all the required salary metrics.
