# ACTION #
During task execution, you can perform **Actions**, including:
1. **Tool Call**
2. **Python Code Execution**

## Action Output Format
1. **Tool Call**
When calling a tool, please output:
<tool_call>
{"name": "<function-name>", "arguments": <args-json-object>}
</tool_call>
- `<function-name>`: Tool function name
- `<args-json-object>`: Call arguments (JSON format)
- If multiple `<tool_call>` are output at once, only the first one will be executed; the rest will be ignored.

Available tool signatures are provided within the `<tools>` tag:
<tools>
{"type": "function", "function": {"name": "extract_image_content_by_gpt4o", "description": "Utilizes `gpt-4o` to interpret and extract content from local image files (e.g., PNG, JPEG). Highly effective for **scanned documents, image-based PDFs (post-conversion to image formats),** or visual data. For optimal extraction, craft precise queries. **Caution: While effective for general content, direct numerical or highly structured extraction from complex visual elements (e.g., tally marks, handwritten notes) may be imprecise; robust post-processing is often required. For multi-page documents, convert each page into a separate image and ensure *all* generated image pages are processed for complete data extraction.**", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"image_path": {"type": "string", "description": "Local image path."}, "query": {"type": "string", "description": "Query to the gpt-4o to get the image content."}}, "required": ["image_path", "query"]}}}

Element indices are dynamic and highly volatile; always verify the target element's existence and index using `browser_wait_and_get_update` immediately before clicking. Be aware that even with immediate updates, indices can shift in very dynamic UIs. Crucially, after clicking, always use `browser_wait_and_get_update` to immediately re-evaluate the page state and confirm the intended effect (e.g., UI changes, navigation). For navigation, `browser_go_to_url` is a more robust alternative when a direct URL is known. For form submissions or general action triggers, `browser_send_keys` with 'Enter' is often a more robust alternative, especially when direct clicking by index proves unreliable. Avoid clicking elements that are not currently visible or interactable.", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"index": {"type": "integer", "description": "The index number of the target element."}}, "required": ["index"]}}}

It cannot process content that is scrolled out of view or exists on other pages of a paginated list. While `accessibility tree` and `interactive elements` are primary for UI understanding, this visual tool can be a highly effective *primary* method for text extraction in challenging scenarios. **Crucially, for critical or structured data (e.g., IDs, specific names, numerical values), always cross-verify with or prefer extraction from the `webpage accessibility tree` as visual interpretation may introduce inaccuracies, especially for abbreviated or visually ambiguous elements.**", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"query": {"type": "string", "description": "Query to the VL model to get the browser page content."}}, "required": ["query"]}}}

Complex shell features like command chaining (`&&`, `||`), pipes (`|`), I/O redirection (`>`, `>>`), and backgrounding (`&`) are often *not reliably interpreted by `run_cmd` directly* and can lead to unexpected behavior or errors (e.g., `SyntaxError`, `command not found`). For any non-trivial shell interaction or complex logic, *always prefer consolidating operations into a single Python script that uses `subprocess` for explicit control and robustness* over multiple `run_cmd` calls or complex shell syntax.** 3) Quote arguments containing spaces (`\"path with spaces\"`). 4) State changes (`cd`) do not persist across calls.", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"command": {"type": "string", "description": "command暂时没有参数描述"}}, "required": ["command"]}}}
</tools>

2. **Python Code Execution**
When executing Python code, please output:
<code>
... your code ...
</code>
- The working directory is `/workspace`
- Executing dangerous, destructive, or time-consuming code is prohibited.
- If both a **Tool Call** and **Python Code Execution** are included in the output, the tool call takes precedence, and the Python code will not be executed.
- Using outdated or limited python libraries may result in incomplete or inaccurate observations (e.g. missing images from PDFs or failing to extract key content). Always prefer robust, modern libraries to ensure full and reliable results.
- When performing file conversion or data extraction, always ensure **data integrity**. Verify that the structure, content, and critical fields of the source file are preserved in the output. Check row and column counts, headers, and key values before and after processing. **Avoid silent loss**, truncation, or unintended alteration of data.

## Action Execution Result Processing
- After each action is executed, an Observation is returned, which includes:
    1. `<tool_response>`: The result of the tool or code execution.
    2. `<tool_instruction>`: The instruction associated with a specific action, used to guide the next step or restrict subsequent behavior.
- **Note**: Do not fabricate observations.

## Security and Restrictions
- **Coding Actions (such as Python, CMD, etc.)**
    - Do not run high-risk operations that are large in code size or take a long time.
    - Do not execute code that could cause data loss, system damage, or irreversible changes.
    - Do not use the kill command with wildcards like * or other dangerous parameters that could result in a wide range of matches.
    - Prefer using the Python interpreter to execute code (safer and more efficient) rather than using the CMD tool.

> ⚠️ **Important**
> When your output contains content that fully conforms to the **Tool Call** or **Python Code Execution** format, the system will immediately parse, identify, and execute it as an **Action** without further confirmation and without reversal.
> Therefore, before outputting, always confirm that this is your **intended** action and fully assess the potential consequences and risks.
> If you are only using **quotes, demonstrations, or examples**, be sure to break the formatting or escape it to prevent the system from interpreting it as a real action.

# OBJECTIVE #
Your core objective is to independently and efficiently complete the tasks assigned to you by the company.


# MEMORY #
During previous tasks, you have accumulated the following reusable knowledge:

## Resolution Patterns
Comprehensive Contextualization: Systematically acquire and aggregate information from diverse, potentially unstructured sources, prioritizing local processing and cross-validation, to ensure a complete, coherent operational view and inform robust decisions.
Robust External Interaction: Prioritize stable, predictable interaction methods, such as structured APIs, and dynamically adapt strategies to ensure continuity and reliability with external systems despite their inconsistencies or volatility.
Adaptive Constraint Handling: When an objective is blocked by an unresolvable external constraint, acknowledge the limitation, perform necessary cleanup of partial artifacts, and adapt the strategy to proceed with viable data, avoiding unproductive retries.
Modular Resilient Design: Decompose operations into modular, decoupled units with explicit state management, to enhance predictability, isolate errors, improve maintainability, and ensure operational continuity.
Progressive Verification: Implement multi-stage validation, from granular checks within pipelines to comprehensive outcome validation, to localize errors, confirm system states, and ensure successful execution.

## Platform/Application Operation Guides
These guides summarize proven operation paths derived from past successful experiences.  
Each item is a structured reference designed to help you complete operations more quickly, accurately, and with reduced redundancy.

> This directory provides a comprehensive index of guides, compiling best practices and experience summaries for accomplishing various tasks.

### Recommended Usage Process
1. **Review the Guide First**  
   Before starting a task, browse the relevant entries in the directory to identify potentially useful guidance.  
2. **Targeted Access**  
   Use the `access_the_application_guide` tool to view detailed steps if necessary.  
3. **Reuse with Flexibility**  
   Apply past successful steps when they fit the current situation, but stay aware of possible mismatches.  
4. **Explore When Deviations Arise**  
   If the environment or results diverge from the guide, stop rigidly following it and explore alternative approaches through small, safe, and adaptive steps.

### Value of Guides
- Reduce task completion time by leveraging accumulated experience.  
- Lower error rates and avoid common pitfalls.  
- Ensure consistent, professional execution of tasks.  

### Guide Reliability & Adaptation
- Guides may be outdated, biased, or contain errors — they are “historical experience,” not absolute truth.  
- Use guides as starting points, not as strict rules.  
- When deviations or conflicts appear, **exit the guide and explore new paths** instead of persisting.  
- Record useful deviation points for later improvement of the guides.

SubTask1: ReadJobDescriptionTemplate
Goal: The content of the job description template from `/instruction/template.md` is successfully read.
05. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================
Thought: The goal is to read a file from the file system. The `System` application in the `Platform/Application Operation Guide Directory` has a `ReadFile` guide that seems relevant. I will access this guide to understand how to proceed.
Action:
<tool_call>
{"name": "access_the_application_guide", "arguments": {"application_name": "System", "item_names": ["ReadFile"]}}

</ReadFile>
</Application>
</tool_response>
<tool_instruction>
After accessing, carefully read the guide content. Extract and adapt relevant steps, recognizing that guide information may be outdated or require UI verification. Always prioritize current browser state by performing `browser_wait_and_get_update()` immediately before attempting to follow guide steps.
</tool_instruction>

07. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================
Thought: I have accessed the `ReadFile` guide, which suggests using `run_cmd` with `cat <file_path>`. The file path for the template is `/instruction/template.md`. I will now execute this command to read the template content.

Title: Subtask Completion Verification Report: ReadJobDescriptionTemplate

Checklist Details:
- **`verify_agent_extracted_content`**: The content presented in the Task Agent's `Final Answer` (ASSISTANT MESSAGE 06) precisely matches the `stdout` observed from the `run_cmd` tool execution in USER MESSAGE 05. This confirms that the Task Agent accurately processed and presented the extracted job description template content.
- **`independently_verify_file_content`**: An independent execution of `run_cmd` with the command `cat /instruction/template.md` yielded output identical to both the Task Agent's observation (USER MESSAGE 05) and its `Final Answer` (ASSISTANT MESSAGE 06). This confirms the existence of the file `/instruction/template.md` and verifies the accuracy of its content as read by the Task Agent.

Conclusion:
The Subtask "ReadJobDescriptionTemplate" is **complete**. The Task Agent successfully read the content of the job description template from `/instruction/template.md`, and this content has been verified to be accurate and complete through both internal consistency checks of the agent's trajectory and independent file system verification.

Thought: I have received the guides for RocketChat Login, Browser Navigation, and Waiting for Page Updates. The RocketChat Login guide clearly states the first step is to navigate to the RocketChat URL and then update the browser state. I will use `browser_go_to_url` to navigate to `http://the-agent-company.com:3000/home` and then `browser_wait_and_get_update` to get the interactive elements for login.

19. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================
Thought: I have successfully navigated to the RocketChat login page. The `webpage interactive elements` show that the input field for "Email or username" has index 4, the "Password" field has index 6, and the "Login" button has index 7. I will now use `browser_input_text` to enter the username and password, followed by `browser_click` to log in. After each input or click, I will use `browser_wait_and_get_update` to refresh the page state and confirm the action. This aligns with the steps outlined in the `RocketChat Login` guide.

After inputting text, always use `browser_wait_and_get_update` to verify the text input, check for immediate validation feedback, or confirm any UI changes (e.g., enable/disable buttons, form submission readiness). Be especially mindful of index volatility, as UI changes can rapidly invalidate previously retrieved indices.

</tool_response>
<tool_instruction>
If an `Element index does not exist` error is returned, it indicates extreme element volatility. **Always re-evaluate `webpage interactive elements` with `browser_wait_and_get_update` immediately before attempting a click, and crucially, confirm the element's `text` or `aria-label` attribute semantically matches the intended target.** If direct clicking by index proves unreliable, *especially within dynamic lists or sidebars (e.g., chat contact lists)*, consider alternative strategies like using an application's built-in search functionality or `browser_go_to_url` if a direct link is known, rather than repeatedly retrying. For form submissions or general action triggers, `browser_send_keys` with 'Enter' is a more robust alternative and **highly recommended for reliability**.
</tool_instruction>

25. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================
Thought: I have successfully navigated to the RocketChat homepage and entered the username and password. The `tool_response` after clicking the login button shows elements characteristic of a logged-in RocketChat interface, such as "Home", "Search", "Directory", "Administration" buttons, and a list of channels. This confirms that the login process was successful and the RocketChat homepage is now accessible. Thus, the subtask "LoginToRocketChat" is complete.
Final Answer: Successfully logged into RocketChat and the homepage is accessible.

Title: Subtask Completion Verification Report: LoginToRocketChat

Checklist Details:
- **`verify_post_login_dashboard_elements`**: The `webpage accessibility tree` in USER MESSAGE 11, observed after the agent's login action, contained expected RocketChat dashboard elements such as 'Home', 'Search', 'Directory', and 'Administration' buttons, as well as various channel links (e.g., 'general', 'kudos'). This directly matches the criteria for successful login verification outlined in the RocketChat Login guide (USER MESSAGE 03).
- **`verify_absence_of_login_form`**: An examination of the `webpage interactive elements` in USER MESSAGE 11 confirmed that the login form components, specifically the username/email input field (index 4 in USER MESSAGE 05), password input field (index 6 in USER MESSAGE 05), and the Login button (index 9 in USER MESSAGE 05 and 09), were no longer present. This absence is a key indicator of successful login as per the RocketChat Login guide (USER MESSAGE 03).
- **`confirm_current_url_is_homepage`**: The `webpage accessibility tree` in USER MESSAGE 11 explicitly reported the current browser URL as `http://the-agent-company.com:3000/home`. This verifies that the browser successfully landed on and remained at the intended RocketChat homepage URL after the login process.

Conclusion:
The Subtask "LoginToRocketChat" is **complete**. The Task Agent successfully logged into RocketChat and the homepage is accessible, as verified by the presence of dashboard elements, the absence of login form elements, and the correct current URL.

Replace `<target_name>` with the actual username or channel name. For channels, the search bar generally works with or without the '#' prefix. Successful navigation is verified by inspecting the `webpage accessibility tree` for the correct chat heading (e.g., `heading '<target_name>'`) and URL (e.g., `http://the-agent-company.com:3000/direct/<user_id>` or `http://the-agent-company.com:3000/channel/<channel_name>`).

Thought: I have the guides for `AccessConversation` and `SendMessage`. I need to find Zhang Wei's direct message conversation. I'm already logged in, so I'll start by getting the current interactive elements to look for a direct message link to "Zhang Wei". If I don't find it, I'll use the search functionality.

Looking at the `webpage interactive elements` from the previous observation (USER MESSAGE 11), I don't immediately see a direct message link for "Zhang Wei". However, I see a "Search" button at index 23 and a "Direct Messages" section header at index 32. It's more reliable to use the search function if the direct message isn't immediately visible. I will click the search button (index 23) to initiate the search.

If an `Element index does not exist` error is returned, it indicates extreme element volatility. **Always re-evaluate `webpage interactive elements` with `browser_wait_and_get_update` immediately before attempting a click, and crucially, confirm the element's `text` or `aria-label` attribute semantically matches the intended target.** If direct clicking by index proves unreliable, *especially within dynamic lists or sidebars (e.g., chat contact lists)*, consider alternative strategies like using an application's built-in search functionality or `browser_go_to_url` if a direct link is known, rather than repeatedly retrying. For form submissions or general action triggers, `browser_send_keys` with 'Enter' is a more robust alternative and **highly recommended for reliability**.

SubTask5: DraftJobDescriptionFile
Goal: A markdown file named `job_description.md` is created locally, containing the merged content of the template and Zhang Wei's requirements.
61. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================
Thought: The goal is to create a markdown file locally by merging the template and Zhang Wei's requirements. This involves string manipulation (merging) and writing a file. The `System` application has `WriteFile` and `ProcessAndFormatStringData` guides that might be useful. I will access these guides.

63. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================
Thought: I have the template content and Zhang Wei's requirements. I need to merge them into a single markdown string and then write it to a file named `job_description.md` in the `/workspace` directory. I will use Python to perform the string replacements and then write the file.

First, I will define the template and the requirements as Python strings. Then, I will use string `replace()` methods to insert the specific requirements into the template. Finally, I will write the combined content to `job_description.md`.

If an `Element index does not exist` error is returned, it indicates extreme element volatility. **Always re-evaluate `webpage interactive elements` with `browser_wait_and_get_update` immediately before attempting a click, and crucially, confirm the element's `text` or `aria-label` attribute semantically matches the intended target.** If direct clicking by index proves unreliable, *especially within dynamic lists or sidebars (e.g., chat contact lists)*, consider alternative strategies like using an application's built-in search functionality or `browser_go_to_url` if a direct link is known, rather than repeatedly retrying. For form submissions or general action triggers, `browser_send_keys` with 'Enter' is a more robust alternative and **highly recommended for reliability**.

This confirms that I am on the ownCloud file management page. There is also an overlay present, which the guide suggests dismissing with 'Escape'.

This is in line with the `UploadFileWebDAV` guide's definition of a successful upload. Therefore, the `job_description.md` file has been successfully uploaded to the `/Documents` directory on ownCloud.

Title: Subtask Completion Verification Report: UploadJobDescriptionToOwnCloud

Checklist Details:
- **`verify_upload_command_result`**: The `tool_response` in USER MESSAGE 09 for the final file upload command shows a `command_result.returncode` of 0 and an empty `stdout`. This confirms that the WebDAV upload command executed successfully from the client-side perspective.
- **`verify_file_existence_on_owncloud`**: An independent `PROPFIND` command executed on the ownCloud WebDAV `/Documents` directory explicitly listed `job_description.md` within its XML `stdout` (`<d:href>/remote.php/webdav/Documents/job_description.md</d:href>`). This verifies the file's presence in the correct location on the ownCloud server.
- **`verify_uploaded_file_content`**: The `job_description.md` file was downloaded from ownCloud and its content was compared byte-for-byte with the local `/workspace/job_description.md` file using a Python script. The script's `stdout` confirmed, "The content of job_description.md on OwnCloud is identical to the local file.", ensuring content integrity and completeness.

Conclusion:
The Subtask "UploadJobDescriptionToOwnCloud" is **complete**. The `job_description.md` file has been successfully uploaded to the `/Documents` directory on ownCloud with its content verified for integrity and completeness.

Thought: I have accessed the `GeneratePublicShareLink` guide. The guide outlines the steps to create a public share link. I am currently logged into ownCloud and on the files page.

Thought: I have clicked on the "Documents" link. However, the `webpage accessibility tree` from the previous observation indicates that the page did not navigate into the "Documents" folder as expected. Instead, it seems to have opened a details panel for the "Documents" folder itself, showing "Private link" and "Comments" sections, but not the contents of the folder. This is not what I intended.

I need to navigate *into* the "Documents" folder to find `job_description.md`. I will go back to the main files view and try a different approach. The `browser_go_back` tool might be useful here. After going back, I will re-evaluate the interactive elements to find a way to enter the "Documents" folder. It's possible the "Documents" link (index 30) was not meant for navigation but for opening a details panel. I will try to find a way to click on the folder name itself, or a different icon, to navigate into it. If direct navigation isn't working, I might need to use `browser_go_to_url` with the direct URL for the Documents folder if I can construct it. First, I will go back.

Title: Subtask Completion Verification Report: GeneratePublicShareLink

Checklist Details:
- **`check_generated_url_presence`**: The public share URL (`http://the-agent-company.com:8092/index.php/s/dhvTx7RP9gW8z81`) was successfully identified and confirmed to be present and correctly formatted within a `readonly textbox` in the `webpage accessibility tree` after the Task Agent's final click action, as observed in USER MESSAGE 21. This directly aligns with the expected output described in the ownCloud guide (USER MESSAGE 03).
- **`verify_public_link_accessibility`**: Proactive navigation to the extracted public URL (`http://the-agent-company.com:8092/index.php/s/dhvTx7RP9gW8z81`) using `browser_go_to_url` (Action in USER MESSAGE 01) successfully loaded a page that clearly indicated the presence of the `job_description.md` file via a "Download job_description.md (4 KB)" link in the `webpage accessibility tree` (USER MESSAGE 02). This confirms the link is active and points to the correct file.
- **`verify_public_link_content_accuracy`**: The `job_description.md` file was downloaded from the public link (via `curl` in USER MESSAGE 01) to `/tmp/downloaded_job_description.md`. A subsequent byte-for-byte comparison of this downloaded file's content with the local `/workspace/job_description.md` file (using `cat` in USER MESSAGE 03 and USER MESSAGE 04) confirmed that their contents are identical. This verifies the integrity and accuracy of the file shared via the public link.

Conclusion:
The Subtask "GeneratePublicShareLink" is **complete**. The Task Agent successfully generated a public share link for the `job_description.md` file on ownCloud, and this link has been verified to be functional, correctly formatted, and providing access to the intended file with accurate content.

Title: Subtask Completion Verification Report: SaveShareLinkToFile

Checklist Details:
- **`verify_agent_output_consistency`**: The Task Agent's Python code execution (USER MESSAGE 05) resulted in `execution_status: "CODE_EXECUTED"`, `returncode: 0`, and `stdout: "Share link saved to /workspace/link.txt"`, indicating successful file writing. This is consistent with the subsequent file checks.
- **`verify_file_existence`**: An independent `run_cmd` execution of `ls -l /workspace/link.txt` confirmed the existence of the file `link.txt` in the `/workspace` directory, with a `returncode` of 0 and relevant file information in `stdout`.
- **`verify_file_content_and_accuracy`**: An independent `run_cmd` execution of `cat /workspace/link.txt` showed that the file's content is `http://the-agent-company.com:8092/index.php/s/dhvTx7RP9gW8z81`.
