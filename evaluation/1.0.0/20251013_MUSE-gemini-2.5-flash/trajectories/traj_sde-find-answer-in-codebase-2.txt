The `webpage interactive elements` from its output are highly dynamic and should be used immediately. For verifying responses or dynamic updates, consider setting `seconds` to a value appropriate for expected latency (e.g., `seconds=1` for immediate state, longer for human-like response times). **This tool is a fundamental prerequisite for almost all subsequent browser interactions due to the highly dynamic nature of web UI element indices.**", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"seconds": {"type": "integer", "description": "The number of seconds to wait, the default is 3 seconds.", "default": 3}}, "required": []}}}

Returns a JSON object with `execution_status`, `returncode`, `stdout`, and `stderr`. **Important Precautions**: 1) `returncode=0` does not guarantee successful side effects (e.g., file creation); always verify with independent checks (`ls -l`, `file`). 2) **This tool executes commands in a *minimal* shell environment. Complex shell features like command chaining (`&&`, `||`), pipes (`|`), I/O redirection (`>`, `>>`), and backgrounding (`&`) are often *not reliably interpreted by `run_cmd` directly* and can lead to unexpected behavior or errors (e.g., `SyntaxError`, `command not found`). For any non-trivial shell interaction or complex logic, *always prefer consolidating operations into a single Python script that uses `subprocess` for explicit control and robustness* over multiple `run_cmd` calls or complex shell syntax.** 3) Quote arguments containing spaces (`\"path with spaces\"`). 4) State changes (`cd`) do not persist across calls.", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"command": {"type": "string", "description": "command暂时没有参数描述"}}, "required": ["command"]}}}

2. **Python Code Execution**
When executing Python code, please output:
<code>
... your code ...
</code>
- The working directory is `/workspace`
- Executing dangerous, destructive, or time-consuming code is prohibited.
- If both a **Tool Call** and **Python Code Execution** are included in the output, the tool call takes precedence, and the Python code will not be executed.
- Using outdated or limited python libraries may result in incomplete or inaccurate observations (e.g. missing images from PDFs or failing to extract key content). Always prefer robust, modern libraries to ensure full and reliable results.
- When performing file conversion or data extraction, always ensure **data integrity**. Verify that the structure, content, and critical fields of the source file are preserved in the output. Check row and column counts, headers, and key values before and after processing. **Avoid silent loss**, truncation, or unintended alteration of data.

## Action Execution Result Processing
- After each action is executed, an Observation is returned, which includes:
    1. `<tool_response>`: The result of the tool or code execution.
    2. `<tool_instruction>`: The instruction associated with a specific action, used to guide the next step or restrict subsequent behavior.
- **Note**: Do not fabricate observations.

## Security and Restrictions
- **Coding Actions (such as Python, CMD, etc.)**
    - Do not run high-risk operations that are large in code size or take a long time.
    - Do not execute code that could cause data loss, system damage, or irreversible changes.
    - Do not use the kill command with wildcards like * or other dangerous parameters that could result in a wide range of matches.
    - Prefer using the Python interpreter to execute code (safer and more efficient) rather than using the CMD tool.

> ⚠️ **Important**
> When your output contains content that fully conforms to the **Tool Call** or **Python Code Execution** format, the system will immediately parse, identify, and execute it as an **Action** without further confirmation and without reversal.
> Therefore, before outputting, always confirm that this is your **intended** action and fully assess the potential consequences and risks.
> If you are only using **quotes, demonstrations, or examples**, be sure to break the formatting or escape it to prevent the system from interpreting it as a real action.

# OBJECTIVE #
Your core objective is to independently and efficiently complete the tasks assigned to you by the company.


# MEMORY #
During previous tasks, you have accumulated the following reusable knowledge:

## Resolution Patterns
Comprehensive Contextualization: Systematically acquire and aggregate information from diverse, potentially unstructured sources, prioritizing local processing and cross-validation, to ensure a complete, coherent operational view and inform robust decisions.
Robust External Interaction: Prioritize stable, predictable interaction methods, such as structured APIs, and dynamically adapt strategies to ensure continuity and reliability with external systems despite their inconsistencies or volatility.
Adaptive Constraint Handling: When an objective is blocked by an unresolvable external constraint, acknowledge the limitation, perform necessary cleanup of partial artifacts, and adapt the strategy to proceed with viable data, avoiding unproductive retries.
Modular Resilient Design: Decompose operations into modular, decoupled units with explicit state management, to enhance predictability, isolate errors, improve maintainability, and ensure operational continuity.
Progressive Verification: Implement multi-stage validation, from granular checks within pipelines to comprehensive outcome validation, to localize errors, confirm system states, and ensure successful execution.

## Platform/Application Operation Guides
These guides summarize proven operation paths derived from past successful experiences.  
Each item is a structured reference designed to help you complete operations more quickly, accurately, and with reduced redundancy.

> This directory provides a comprehensive index of guides, compiling best practices and experience summaries for accomplishing various tasks.

### Recommended Usage Process
1. **Review the Guide First**  
   Before starting a task, browse the relevant entries in the directory to identify potentially useful guidance.  
2. **Targeted Access**  
   Use the `access_the_application_guide` tool to view detailed steps if necessary.  
3. **Reuse with Flexibility**  
   Apply past successful steps when they fit the current situation, but stay aware of possible mismatches.  
4. **Explore When Deviations Arise**  
   If the environment or results diverge from the guide, stop rigidly following it and explore alternative approaches through small, safe, and adaptive steps.

### Value of Guides
- Reduce task completion time by leveraging accumulated experience.  
- Lower error rates and avoid common pitfalls.  
- Ensure consistent, professional execution of tasks.  

### Guide Reliability & Adaptation
- Guides may be outdated, biased, or contain errors — they are “historical experience,” not absolute truth.  
- Use guides as starting points, not as strict rules.  
- When deviations or conflicts appear, **exit the guide and explore new paths** instead of persisting.  
- Record useful deviation points for later improvement of the guides.

I will use `browser_send_keys` to input the search query. This method is more robust as it sends keystrokes to the currently focused element, which should be the search box within the command palette.

The `webpage accessibility tree` in Observation from step 39 confirms the URL is `http://the-agent-company.com:8929/root/llama.cpp/-/blame/master/ggml/src/ggml-sycl/dequantize.hpp#L1` and the title is `'Blame · ggml/src/ggml-sycl/dequantize.hpp · master · Administrator / llama.cpp · GitLab'`, matching the expected blame page for the specified file.

2.  **CheckStep: extract_merge_request_and_date_from_blame**
    -   **CheckGoal**: Extract all unique merge request numbers (e.g., #XXXX) and their corresponding commit dates visible on the blame page.
    -   **Result**: PASSED. The following merge requests and their commit dates were extracted from Observation in step 39:
        -   Merge Request ID: #6408, Commit Date: June 19, 2024
        -   Merge Request ID: #9052, Commit Date: August 20, 2024
        -   Merge Request ID: #9711, Commit Date: October 3, 2024
        -   Merge Request ID: #8255, Commit Date: July 3, 2024

3.  **CheckStep: confirm_latest_merge_request_id**
    -   **CheckGoal**: Based on the extracted data, verify that the merge request ID '9711' is indeed the latest one by its commit date, as identified by the Task Agent.
    -   **Result**: PASSED. Comparing the extracted commit dates, October 3, 2024 (associated with #9711) is indeed the latest date among the listed merge requests.

Conclusion:
The Subtask "Find_Latest_Merge_Request_for_File" is **complete**. All verification steps passed, confirming that the Task Agent successfully navigated to the blame page, extracted the necessary information, and correctly identified the latest merge request ID as 9711.

Title: Subtask Completion Report: RocketChat_Login Verification

Checklist Details:
1.  **CheckStep: verify_final_url**
    *   **CheckGoal**: Confirm that the browser's current URL is 'http://the-agent-company.com:3000/home', which is the expected URL after a successful login to the Rocket.Chat dashboard.
    *   **Result**: PASSED. The `webpage accessibility tree` in Observation from step 11 confirms the URL is `'http://the-agent-company.com:3000/home'`, matching the expected URL after a successful login.

2.  **CheckStep: verify_page_title**
    *   **CheckGoal**: Check if the page title is 'Rocket.Chat', indicating a successful login to the main application interface.
    *   **Result**: PASSED. The `webpage accessibility tree` in Observation from step 11 states the page title as `'Rocket.Chat'`, matching the expected title.

3.  **CheckStep: verify_dashboard_elements_and_absence_of_login_form**
    *   **CheckGoal**: Ensure the presence of key dashboard UI elements such as 'Home', 'Search', and channel lists ('general', 'kudos', 'mike_chen', 'chen_xinyi') in the `webpage accessibility tree`, and simultaneously confirm the absence of login form input fields and the 'Login' button in the `webpage interactive elements`, confirming the user is past the login screen.
    *   **Result**: PASSED. The `webpage accessibility tree` in Observation from step 11 clearly shows the presence of dashboard elements like `button 'Home'`, `button 'Search'`, `button 'Directory'`, `button 'Display'`, `button 'Create new'`, `button 'Administration'`, and channel links such as `'general'`, `'kudos'`, `'mike_chen'`, and `'chen_xinyi'`. Concurrently, the `webpage interactive elements` from step 11 confirm the absence of input fields for username and password, as well as the 'Login' button, which were present before authentication. This unequivocally demonstrates successful login and navigation beyond the login screen.

Conclusion:
The Subtask "RocketChat_Login" is **complete**. All verification steps passed, confirming that the Task Agent successfully logged into Rocket.Chat, reached the expected dashboard URL, displayed the correct page title, and showed the expected dashboard UI elements while the login form elements were absent.

    *   **CheckGoal**: Within the same `webpage accessibility tree` in step 11, verify that the posted message is attributed to 'theagentcompany' (the current user) and has a timestamp (e.g., '2:08 AM'). This confirms the message was sent by the agent and is a new, visible entry.
    *   **Result**: PASSED. The `webpage accessibility tree` in Observation from step 11 shows `StaticText 'theagentcompany'` as the sender and `StaticText '2:08 AM'` as the timestamp for the message "The latest pull request that changes ggml/src/ggml-sycl/dequantize.hpp in llama.cpp is #9711", confirming that the message was sent by the agent with a visible timestamp.

4.  **CheckStep: verify_message_input_field_cleared**
    *   **CheckGoal**: After sending the message, examine the `webpage interactive elements` in the final observation (step 11) to confirm that the text area previously used for input (index 67, labeled 'Message', placeholder 'Message') is now empty, which indicates the message was successfully processed and the input field reset.
    *   **Result**: PASSED. The `webpage interactive elements` from Observation in step 11 show the `textarea` with index 67 and `placeholder="Message"` has a `text` attribute of `<textarea name=msg placeholder=Message/>`, indicating that the input field is empty and has been cleared after the message was sent.

Conclusion:
The Subtask "Send_Message_to_Chen_Xinyi" is **complete**. All verification steps passed, confirming that the Task Agent successfully sent the merge request number to Chen Xinyi in Rocket.Chat, and the message content, sender, timestamp, and cleared input field were all verified.
