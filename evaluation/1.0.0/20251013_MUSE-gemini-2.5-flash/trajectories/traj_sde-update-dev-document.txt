Complex shell features like command chaining (`&&`, `||`), pipes (`|`), I/O redirection (`>`, `>>`), and backgrounding (`&`) are often *not reliably interpreted by `run_cmd` directly* and can lead to unexpected behavior or errors (e.g., `SyntaxError`, `command not found`). For any non-trivial shell interaction or complex logic, *always prefer consolidating operations into a single Python script that uses `subprocess` for explicit control and robustness* over multiple `run_cmd` calls or complex shell syntax.** 3) Quote arguments containing spaces (`\"path with spaces\"`). 4) State changes (`cd`) do not persist across calls.", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"command": {"type": "string", "description": "command暂时没有参数描述"}}, "required": ["command"]}}}
</tools>

2. **Python Code Execution**
When executing Python code, please output:
<code>
... your code ...
</code>
- The working directory is `/workspace`
- Executing dangerous, destructive, or time-consuming code is prohibited.
- If both a **Tool Call** and **Python Code Execution** are included in the output, the tool call takes precedence, and the Python code will not be executed.
- Using outdated or limited python libraries may result in incomplete or inaccurate observations (e.g. missing images from PDFs or failing to extract key content). Always prefer robust, modern libraries to ensure full and reliable results.
- When performing file conversion or data extraction, always ensure **data integrity**. Verify that the structure, content, and critical fields of the source file are preserved in the output. Check row and column counts, headers, and key values before and after processing. **Avoid silent loss**, truncation, or unintended alteration of data.

## Action Execution Result Processing
- After each action is executed, an Observation is returned, which includes:
    1. `<tool_response>`: The result of the tool or code execution.
    2. `<tool_instruction>`: The instruction associated with a specific action, used to guide the next step or restrict subsequent behavior.
- **Note**: Do not fabricate observations.

## Security and Restrictions
- **Coding Actions (such as Python, CMD, etc.)**
    - Do not run high-risk operations that are large in code size or take a long time.
    - Do not execute code that could cause data loss, system damage, or irreversible changes.
    - Do not use the kill command with wildcards like * or other dangerous parameters that could result in a wide range of matches.
    - Prefer using the Python interpreter to execute code (safer and more efficient) rather than using the CMD tool.

> ⚠️ **Important**
> When your output contains content that fully conforms to the **Tool Call** or **Python Code Execution** format, the system will immediately parse, identify, and execute it as an **Action** without further confirmation and without reversal.
> Therefore, before outputting, always confirm that this is your **intended** action and fully assess the potential consequences and risks.
> If you are only using **quotes, demonstrations, or examples**, be sure to break the formatting or escape it to prevent the system from interpreting it as a real action.

# OBJECTIVE #
Your core objective is to independently and efficiently complete the tasks assigned to you by the company.


# MEMORY #
During previous tasks, you have accumulated the following reusable knowledge:

## Resolution Patterns
Comprehensive Contextualization: Systematically acquire and aggregate information from diverse, potentially unstructured sources, prioritizing local processing and cross-validation, to ensure a complete, coherent operational view and inform robust decisions.
Robust External Interaction: Prioritize stable, predictable interaction methods, such as structured APIs, and dynamically adapt strategies to ensure continuity and reliability with external systems despite their inconsistencies or volatility.
Adaptive Constraint Handling: When an objective is blocked by an unresolvable external constraint, acknowledge the limitation, perform necessary cleanup of partial artifacts, and adapt the strategy to proceed with viable data, avoiding unproductive retries.
Modular Resilient Design: Decompose operations into modular, decoupled units with explicit state management, to enhance predictability, isolate errors, improve maintainability, and ensure operational continuity.
Progressive Verification: Implement multi-stage validation, from granular checks within pipelines to comprehensive outcome validation, to localize errors, confirm system states, and ensure successful execution.

## Platform/Application Operation Guides
These guides summarize proven operation paths derived from past successful experiences.  
Each item is a structured reference designed to help you complete operations more quickly, accurately, and with reduced redundancy.

> This directory provides a comprehensive index of guides, compiling best practices and experience summaries for accomplishing various tasks.

### Recommended Usage Process
1. **Review the Guide First**  
   Before starting a task, browse the relevant entries in the directory to identify potentially useful guidance.  
2. **Targeted Access**  
   Use the `access_the_application_guide` tool to view detailed steps if necessary.  
3. **Reuse with Flexibility**  
   Apply past successful steps when they fit the current situation, but stay aware of possible mismatches.  
4. **Explore When Deviations Arise**  
   If the environment or results diverge from the guide, stop rigidly following it and explore alternative approaches through small, safe, and adaptive steps.

### Value of Guides
- Reduce task completion time by leveraging accumulated experience.  
- Lower error rates and avoid common pitfalls.  
- Ensure consistent, professional execution of tasks.  

### Guide Reliability & Adaptation
- Guides may be outdated, biased, or contain errors — they are “historical experience,” not absolute truth.  
- Use guides as starting points, not as strict rules.  
- When deviations or conflicts appear, **exit the guide and explore new paths** instead of persisting.  
- Record useful deviation points for later improvement of the guides.

We welcome and appreciate contributions.\n\n## How Can I Contribute?\n\nThere are many ways that you can contribute:\n\n1. **Download and use** Sotopia, and send [issues](https://github.com/sotopia-lab/sotopia/issues) when you encounter something that isn't working or a feature that you'd like to see.\n2. **Send feedback** after each session by using our feedback mechanisms (if implemented), so we can see where things are working and failing, and also build an open dataset for training social agents.\n3. **Improve the Codebase** by sending PRs (see details below). In particular, we have some [good first issue](https://github.com/sotopia-lab/sotopia/labels/good%20first%20issue) issues that may be ones to start on.\n\n## Understanding Sotopia's CodeBase\n\nTo understand the codebase, please refer to the README in each module:\n- [sotopia](./sotopia/README.md)\n- [docs](./docs/README.md)\n- [tests](./tests/README.md)\n\nWhen you write code, it is also good to write tests. Please navigate to the `tests` folder to see existing test suites.\nAt the moment, we have different kinds of tests including unit tests and integration tests. Please refer to the README for each test suite. These tests also run on GitHub's continuous integration to ensure quality of the project.\n\n## Sending Pull Requests to Sotopia\n\n### 1. Fork the Official Repository\nFork the [Sotopia repository](https://github.com/sotopia-lab/sotopia) into your own account.\nClone your own forked repository into your local environment:\n\n```shell\ngit clone git@github.com:<YOUR-USERNAME>/sotopia.git\n```\n\n### 2. Configure Git\n\nSet the official repository as your [upstream](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/git-forks-and-upstreams) to synchronize with the latest update in the official repository.\nAdd the original repository as upstream:\n\n```shell\ncd sotopia\ngit remote add upstream git@github.com:sotopia-lab/sotopia.git\n```\n\nVerify that the remote is set:\n\n```shell\ngit remote -v\n```\n\nYou should see both `origin` and `upstream` in the output.\n\n### 3. Synchronize with Official Repository\nSynchronize latest commit with official repository before coding:\n\n```shell\ngit fetch upstream\ngit checkout main\ngit merge upstream/main\ngit push origin main\n```\n\n### 4. Set up the Development Environment\n\n?? @ProKil\n\n### 5. Write Code and Commit It\n\nOnce you have done this, you can write code, test it, and commit it to a branch (replace `my_branch` with an appropriate name):\n\n```shell\ngit checkout -b my_branch\ngit add .\ngit commit\ngit push origin my_branch\n```\n\n### 6. Open a Pull Request\n\n* On GitHub, go to the page of your forked repository, and create a Pull Request:\n   - Click on `Branches`\n   - Click on the `...` beside your branch and click on `New pull request`\n   - Set `base repository` to `sotopia-lab/sotopia`\n   - Set `base` to `main`\n   - Click `Create pull request`\n\nThe PR should appear in [Sotopia PRs](https://github.com/sotopia-lab/sotopia/pulls).\n\nThen the Sotopia team will review your code.\n\n## PR Rules\n\n### 1. Pull Request title\nAs described [here](https://github.com/commitizen/conventional-commit-types/blob/master/index.json), a valid PR title should begin with one of the following prefixes:\n\n- `feat`: A new feature\n- `fix`: A bug fix\n- `docs`: Documentation only changes\n- `style`: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white space, formatting, missing semicolons, etc.)\n- `refactor`: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature\n- `perf`: A code change that improves performance\n- `test`: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests\n- `build`: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies (example scopes: gulp, broccoli, npm)\n- `ci`: Changes to our CI configuration files and scripts (example scopes: Travis, Circle, BrowserStack, SauceLabs)\n- `chore`: Other changes that don't modify src or test files\n- `revert`: Reverts a previous commit\n\nFor example, a PR title could be:\n- `refactor: modify package path`\n- `feat(frontend): xxxx`, where `(frontend)` means that this PR mainly focuses on the frontend component.\n\nYou may also check out previous PRs in the [PR list](https://github.com/sotopia-lab/sotopia/pulls).\n\n### 2. Pull Request description\n- If your PR is small (such as a typo fix), you can go brief.\n- If it contains a lot of changes, it's better to write more details.",

Title: Subtask Completion Report: Read Contribution Document Content

Checklist Details:
1.  **Cat Command Success**: The `run_cmd` action to 'cat' the contribution document executed successfully. The Task Agent's observation in Step 05 (`<tool_response>` output) explicitly states `execution_status: "COMMAND_EXECUTED"` and `command_result.returncode: 0`, confirming that the command ran without execution errors.
2.  **Content Validation**: The `stdout` from the `cat` command (Step 05, `<tool_response>` `stdout` field) contains the expected content of the `contribution.md` file. The output begins with "# Contributing", is not empty, and includes various sections typical for a contribution guide (e.g., "How Can I Contribute?", "Understanding Sotopia's CodeBase", "Sending Pull Requests to Sotopia"). The `stdout_truncated` field was `false`, indicating the full content was retrieved.

## Development Environment Setup

To ensure a consistent and efficient development workflow, we recommend using Dev Containers. This approach provides a reproducible environment with all necessary dependencies pre-configured.

### Using vscode

VS Code offers excellent integration with Dev Containers.

1.  **Install VS Code and Dev Containers Extension**: If you haven't already, install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and the [Dev Containers extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers).
2.  **Open Project in Container**:
    *   Clone the `sotopia` repository to your local machine.
    *   Open the `sotopia` folder in VS Code.
    *   VS Code should detect the `.devcontainer` folder and prompt you to "Reopen in Container". Click this button.
    *   If you don't see the prompt, open the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P or Cmd+Shift+P), type "Dev Containers: Reopen in Container", and select the command.
3.  **Start Developing**: Once the container is built and running, you will have a fully configured development environment, including all dependencies and tools.

### Other ides or editors

While VS Code has the most seamless integration, you can still leverage Dev Containers with other IDEs or editors that support the Dev Container Specification, or by manually connecting to the running container.

1.  **Build and Run the Dev Container**:
    *   Ensure you have Docker installed and running.
    *   Navigate to the `sotopia` directory in your terminal.
    *   Use the Dev Container CLI (if installed) or Docker commands to build and run the container. For example, using the Dev Container CLI:
        ```bash
        devcontainer up --workspace-folder .
        ```
    *   Alternatively, you can manually build and run the Docker image defined in `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` and `Dockerfile`.
2.  **Connect Your IDE/Editor**:
    *   **SSH**: Many IDEs (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, PyCharm) support connecting to a remote development environment via SSH. You can configure an SSH server within your Dev Container or connect to the running Docker container directly.
    *   **Remote Development Extensions**: Check if your IDE has specific remote development extensions that can connect to Docker containers.

### Without dev containers

If you prefer not to use Dev Containers, you can set up your development environment manually.

1.  **Install Dependencies**:
    *   Ensure you have Python (version X.Y, check `pyproject.toml` or `sotopia/pyproject.toml` for exact version) and `poetry` installed.
    *   Navigate to the `sotopia` directory.
    *   Install project dependencies using poetry:
        ```bash
        poetry install
        ```
2.  **Activate Virtual Environment**:
    ```bash
    poetry shell
    ```
3.  **Run Tests/Development**: You can now run tests or develop directly in your local environment.
```

3.  **'Other ides or editors' Subtitle Verification**: The generated instructions explicitly include the subtitle '### Other ides or editors', as verified by direct inspection of the `Final Answer` content in step 02.
4.  **'Without dev containers' Subtitle Verification**: The generated instructions explicitly include the subtitle '### Without dev containers', as verified by direct inspection of the `Final Answer` content in step 02.

Conclusion:
All verification checks have passed. The Task Agent has successfully completed the "Generate Dev Container Instructions" subtask by creating the specific text content, including all three required subtitles, that needs to be added to the contribution document.

Title: Subtask Completion Report: Commit Changes

Checklist Details:
1.  **Commit Existence and Message Verification**: The command `git -C /workspace/sotopia log --oneline -1` was executed. The `stdout` returned `97f59bb docs: Update contribution document with dev container instructions`, confirming that a commit with the expected message "docs: Update contribution document with dev container instructions" and hash `97f59bb` exists on the current branch. This aligns with the Task Agent's observation in Step 11.
2.  **File Status After Commit Verification**: The command `git -C /workspace/sotopia status` was executed. The `stdout` reported "On branch update-contribution-document\nnothing to commit, working tree clean", which explicitly indicates that the `contribution.md` file is clean (not modified or staged) and its changes were successfully recorded in the commit.
3.  **Current Branch Verification**: The command `git -C /workspace/sotopia rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD` was executed to confirm the active branch. The `stdout` returned `update-contribution-document`, verifying that the commit was indeed made on the `update-contribution-document` branch. This also aligns with the `git status` output.

Conclusion:
All verification checks have passed. The Task Agent has successfully completed the "Commit Changes" subtask by committing the modified contribution document to the `update-contribution-document` branch with the appropriate commit message.

SubTask9: Push Changes
Goal: The newly created branch with the committed changes is successfully pushed to the GitLab repository.
99. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================
Thought: I need to push the changes to the remote GitLab repository. The `CommitAndPushChanges` guide in GitLab provides the necessary command for this. I will use the `run_cmd` tool to execute the `git push` command. The command format is `git -C <repository_path> push http://<username>:<password>@<gitlab_domain>/<group>/<project_name>.git <branch_name>`.

*   `repository_path`: `/workspace/sotopia`
*   `username`: `root`
*   `password`: `theagentcompany`
*   `gitlab_domain`: `the-agent-company.com:8929`
*   `group`: `root` (since it's a root project)
*   `project_name`: `sotopia`
*   `branch_name`: `update-contribution-document`

So the full command will be: `git -C /workspace/sotopia push http://root:theagentcompany@the-agent-company.com:8929/root/sotopia.git update-contribution-document`
Action:
<tool_call>
{"name": "run_cmd", "arguments": {"command": "git -C /workspace/sotopia push http://root:theagentcompany@the-agent-company.com:8929/root/sotopia.git update-contribution-document"}}

Always check `command_result.returncode`: `0` indicates success; non-zero suggests an error; analyze `command_result.stderr`. For successful commands, process `command_result.stdout`. *Note: `command_result.stderr` may contain non-error information; evaluate contextually.* **Crucially, for any sequence of shell commands or when integrating shell output with Python logic, *always encapsulate the entire interaction within a single Python script using `subprocess`* for maximum robustness and control, rather than relying on discrete `run_cmd` calls or shell features like redirection.**
</tool_instruction>

101. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================
Thought: The `git push` command executed successfully, indicated by `returncode: 0`. The `stderr` output confirms that the new branch `update-contribution-document` was pushed to the remote repository. This means the subtask of pushing changes is complete.
Final Answer: The newly created branch with the committed changes has been successfully pushed to the GitLab repository.

Title: Subtask Completion Report: Push Changes

Checklist Details:
1.  **Git Push Command Success Verification**: The `run_cmd` action to perform the `git push` (Task Agent's Step 02) executed successfully, as indicated by `command_result.returncode: 0` in the `<tool_response>` (Task Agent's Step 03).
2.  **Remote Branch Confirmation via Stderr Output**: The `stderr` output from the `git push` command (Task Agent's Step 03, `stderr` field) explicitly contained the lines "remote: To create a merge request for update-contribution-document, visit:" and "* [new branch] update-contribution-document -> update-contribution-document". This confirms that the remote GitLab repository processed and acknowledged the new branch.
3.  **Verify Remote Branch Existence**: I proactively navigated to the GitLab project's branches page (`http://the-agent-company.com:8929/root/sotopia/-/branches`). The `webpage accessibility tree` on this page explicitly listed a `link` with the `StaticText 'update-contribution-document'` under the "Active branches" section. This directly confirms the existence of the `update-contribution-document` branch on the remote GitLab repository.

Conclusion:
All verification checks have passed. The Task Agent has successfully completed the "Push Changes" subtask by pushing the newly created branch with the committed changes to the GitLab repository.
