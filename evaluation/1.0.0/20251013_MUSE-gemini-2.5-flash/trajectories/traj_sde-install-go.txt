</tools>

2. **Python Code Execution**
When executing Python code, please output:
<code>
... your code ...
</code>
- The working directory is `/workspace`
- Executing dangerous, destructive, or time-consuming code is prohibited.
- If both a **Tool Call** and **Python Code Execution** are included in the output, the tool call takes precedence, and the Python code will not be executed.
- Using outdated or limited python libraries may result in incomplete or inaccurate observations (e.g. missing images from PDFs or failing to extract key content). Always prefer robust, modern libraries to ensure full and reliable results.
- When performing file conversion or data extraction, always ensure **data integrity**. Verify that the structure, content, and critical fields of the source file are preserved in the output. Check row and column counts, headers, and key values before and after processing. **Avoid silent loss**, truncation, or unintended alteration of data.

## Action Execution Result Processing
- After each action is executed, an Observation is returned, which includes:
    1. `<tool_response>`: The result of the tool or code execution.
    2. `<tool_instruction>`: The instruction associated with a specific action, used to guide the next step or restrict subsequent behavior.
- **Note**: Do not fabricate observations.

## Security and Restrictions
- **Coding Actions (such as Python, CMD, etc.)**
    - Do not run high-risk operations that are large in code size or take a long time.
    - Do not execute code that could cause data loss, system damage, or irreversible changes.
    - Do not use the kill command with wildcards like * or other dangerous parameters that could result in a wide range of matches.
    - Prefer using the Python interpreter to execute code (safer and more efficient) rather than using the CMD tool.

> ⚠️ **Important**
> When your output contains content that fully conforms to the **Tool Call** or **Python Code Execution** format, the system will immediately parse, identify, and execute it as an **Action** without further confirmation and without reversal.
> Therefore, before outputting, always confirm that this is your **intended** action and fully assess the potential consequences and risks.
> If you are only using **quotes, demonstrations, or examples**, be sure to break the formatting or escape it to prevent the system from interpreting it as a real action.

# OBJECTIVE #
Your core objective is to independently and efficiently complete the tasks assigned to you by the company.


# MEMORY #
During previous tasks, you have accumulated the following reusable knowledge:

## Resolution Patterns
Comprehensive Contextualization: Systematically acquire and aggregate information from diverse, potentially unstructured sources, prioritizing local processing and cross-validation, to ensure a complete, coherent operational view and inform robust decisions.
Robust External Interaction: Prioritize stable, predictable interaction methods, such as structured APIs, and dynamically adapt strategies to ensure continuity and reliability with external systems despite their inconsistencies or volatility.
Adaptive Constraint Handling: When an objective is blocked by an unresolvable external constraint, acknowledge the limitation, perform necessary cleanup of partial artifacts, and adapt the strategy to proceed with viable data, avoiding unproductive retries.
Modular Resilient Design: Decompose operations into modular, decoupled units with explicit state management, to enhance predictability, isolate errors, improve maintainability, and ensure operational continuity.
Progressive Verification: Implement multi-stage validation, from granular checks within pipelines to comprehensive outcome validation, to localize errors, confirm system states, and ensure successful execution.

## Platform/Application Operation Guides
These guides summarize proven operation paths derived from past successful experiences.  
Each item is a structured reference designed to help you complete operations more quickly, accurately, and with reduced redundancy.

> This directory provides a comprehensive index of guides, compiling best practices and experience summaries for accomplishing various tasks.

### Recommended Usage Process
1. **Review the Guide First**  
   Before starting a task, browse the relevant entries in the directory to identify potentially useful guidance.  
2. **Targeted Access**  
   Use the `access_the_application_guide` tool to view detailed steps if necessary.  
3. **Reuse with Flexibility**  
   Apply past successful steps when they fit the current situation, but stay aware of possible mismatches.  
4. **Explore When Deviations Arise**  
   If the environment or results diverge from the guide, stop rigidly following it and explore alternative approaches through small, safe, and adaptive steps.

### Value of Guides
- Reduce task completion time by leveraging accumulated experience.  
- Lower error rates and avoid common pitfalls.  
- Ensure consistent, professional execution of tasks.  

### Guide Reliability & Adaptation
- Guides may be outdated, biased, or contain errors — they are “historical experience,” not absolute truth.  
- Use guides as starting points, not as strict rules.  
- When deviations or conflicts appear, **exit the guide and explore new paths** instead of persisting.  
- Record useful deviation points for later improvement of the guides.

<task>
Install go 1.17
Make sure Go is installed and available in the global PATH (the evaluation for your result would be a simple `go version` in a new cmd, that need persistent modify).
</task>
03. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================
* The information you know and have obtained is:
    1.  **Task Goal**: Install Go 1.17 and ensure it's persistently added to the system's global PATH environment variable.
    2.  **Verification Method**: The success of the installation will be verified by running `go version` in a new command-line session.
    3.  **Available Tools**: I can use `run_cmd` for executing shell commands, `access_the_application_guide` for operational guides, and execute Python code.
    4.  **Working Environment**: The default working directory is `/workspace`. Shell commands are executed in a Linux-like environment, as indicated by examples like `apt-get`, `curl`, `wget`.
    5.  **Persistent PATH Modification**: This is a critical requirement. It implies modifying system-wide or user-specific shell configuration files (e.g., `.bashrc`, `.profile`, `/etc/profile`, `/etc/environment`) to make the Go binary accessible without manual intervention on every new session.

* The task can be divided into the following subtasks:
    1. Determine Go 1.17 download URL: Identify the correct and official download URL for the Go 1.17 Linux tarball.
    2. Download Go 1.17 tarball: Successfully download the Go 1.17 tarball to the `/workspace` directory.
    3. Extract Go to `/usr/local`: Extract the downloaded Go tarball into the `/usr/local/go` directory, ensuring all necessary files are present.
    4. Configure Go environment variables for persistence: Modify a system-wide configuration file (e.g., `/etc/profile` or `/etc/environment`) to permanently add `/usr/local/go/bin` to the system's `PATH`.
    5. Reload environment variables: Ensure that the changes made to the environment variables are loaded for the current and future sessions.
    6. Verify Go installation: Confirm that Go 1.17 is correctly installed and accessible by running `go version` and receiving the expected output.

SubTask1: Determine Go 1.17 download URL
Goal: Identify the correct and official download URL for the Go 1.17 Linux tarball.
05. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================
Thought: The first step is to determine the Go 1.17 download URL. I should check the `System` guides for anything related to downloading or installing software. If nothing relevant is found, I will use `run_cmd` to perform a web search.

For now, I'll check the `System` guides.

<tool_instruction>
Always check `command_result.returncode`: `0` indicates success; non-zero suggests an error; analyze `command_result.stderr`. For successful commands, process `command_result.stdout`. *Note: `command_result.stderr` may contain non-error information; evaluate contextually.* **Crucially, for any sequence of shell commands or when integrating shell output with Python logic, *always encapsulate the entire interaction within a single Python script using `subprocess`* for maximum robustness and control, rather than relying on discrete `run_cmd` calls or shell features like redirection.**

Thought: The previous `curl` command indicated a permanent redirect. I need to follow the redirect to `https://go.dev/dl/` to get the actual download page content. I will use `curl` again with the updated URL.
Action:
<tool_call>
{"name": "run_cmd", "arguments": {"command": "curl -s https://go.dev/dl/"}}

Thought: The previous `curl` command returned a truncated output, preventing me from finding the Go 1.17 download link. I need to get the full content of the page or at least target the specific version. I will try to use `curl` again, but this time I'll pipe the output to `grep` to search for "go1.17" and "linux-amd64.tar.gz" to see if I can extract the URL directly. This might work even with truncation if the relevant line appears early enough in the output. If not, I will need to consider a different approach to get the full page content.

Thought: I have successfully extracted the download links for Go 1.17 versions. The task requires installing Go 1.17, and the latest patch version available in the output is `go1.17.13.linux-amd64.tar.gz`. Therefore, the correct and official download URL for Go 1.17 is `https://go.dev/dl/go1.17.13.linux-amd64.tar.gz`. This completes the first subtask.
Final Answer: https://go.dev/dl/go1.17.13.linux-amd64.tar.gz

## Subtask 1 Completion Verification Report

### Checklist Details
- **check_extracted_url_from_trace**: The Task Agent's identified URL, `https://go.dev/dl/go1.17.13.linux-amd64.tar.gz`, was explicitly found within the `stdout` of the `grep` command in Observation 9. This confirms the agent successfully extracted the relevant link from the webpage content.
- **check_url_accessibility_and_content_type**: Proactive verification of the identified URL `https://go.dev/dl/go1.17.13.linux-amd64.tar.gz` confirmed its authenticity and validity. The initial request resulted in an `HTTP/2 302` redirect. The subsequent request to the redirected URL, `https://dl.google.com/go/go1.17.13.linux-amd64.tar.gz`, returned an `HTTP/2 200 OK` status and a `Content-Type` of `application/x-gzip`. This indicates that the URL points to a live and correct tarball download for Go 1.17.

### Conclusion
The current Subtask, "Determine Go 1.17 download URL", is **complete**. The Task Agent has successfully identified and presented a valid and accessible download URL for the Go 1.17.13 Linux AMD64 tarball, which has been verified to be authentic and deliver the correct file type.

The current subtask has been successfully completed, and substantial new information has been obtained.  
Carefully review the updated context and determine how this new knowledge impacts the overall task progress.  
Design the next subtask to effectively leverage these insights and move closer to completing the full task.

Always remember that your ultimate goal is to complete task:
<task>
Install go 1.17
Make sure Go is installed and available in the global PATH (the evaluation for your result would be a simple `go version` in a new cmd, that need persistent modify).
</task>
17. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================
* The information you know and have obtained is:
    1.  **Task Goal**: Install Go 1.17 and ensure it's persistently added to the system's global PATH environment variable. The final verification will be `go version` in a new command session.
    2.  **Go 1.17 Download URL**: The official download URL for the Go 1.17.13 Linux AMD64 tarball is `https://go.dev/dl/go1.17.13.linux-amd64.tar.gz`. This URL has been verified to be accessible and points to the correct file type.
    3.  **Installation Location**: Conventional installation practice for Go on Linux is to extract the tarball to `/usr/local`, resulting in a `/usr/local/go` directory.
    4.  **Persistent PATH Modification Requirement**: The `PATH` environment variable needs to be modified to include the Go binary directory (`/usr/local/go/bin`) and this modification must be persistent across new command-line sessions. This typically involves editing system-wide configuration files (e.g., `/etc/profile`, `/etc/environment`).
    5.  **Available Tools**: I can use `run_cmd` for executing shell commands, `access_the_application_guide` for retrieving operation guides, and execute Python code.
    6.  **Working Environment**: The default working directory is `/workspace`, and shell commands are executed in a Linux-like environment.

* The task can be divided into the following subtasks:
    1. Download Go 1.17: Download the Go 1.17.13 Linux AMD64 tarball to the /workspace directory.
    2. Extract Go to /usr/local: Extract the downloaded Go tarball into the /usr/local/go directory.
    3. Configure Go environment variables for persistence: Modify a system-wide environment configuration file to permanently add /usr/local/go/bin to the system's PATH.
    4. Verify Go installation: Confirm that Go 1.17 is correctly installed and accessible by running 'go version' in a new command session and receiving the expected output.

SubTask2: Download Go 1.17
Goal: Download the Go 1.17.13 Linux AMD64 tarball to the /workspace directory.

Thought: I need to download the Go 1.17.13 Linux AMD64 tarball. The `System` application guide might have relevant entries for downloading files. I will check for guides related to file downloads or shell commands that can perform downloads.

{'preconditions': 'The command to be executed is a valid shell command and the system has necessary binaries. For complex shell features like command chaining (`&&`, `||`), pipes (`|`), or I/O redirection (`>`, `>>`), encapsulate the entire interaction within a single Python script using `subprocess`.', 'steps': 'For simple, single commands: `run_cmd(command="<your_command_string>")`. -> For complex commands, command chaining, or integration with Python logic: Execute Python code using `subprocess.run` (e.g., `import subprocess; result = subprocess.run(["ls", "-l", "/path/to/file"], capture_output=True, text=True, check=True); print(result.stdout)`)', 'notes': "Important: For any non-trivial shell interaction, *always prefer consolidating logic into a single Python script that uses `subprocess` for explicit control and robustness* over multiple `run_cmd` calls or complex shell syntax (e.g., chaining with `&&`, `||`, pipes `|`, or redirection `>`). `run_cmd` executes commands in a minimal environment and complex shell features may not be reliably interpreted. `execution_status` from `run_cmd` should be 'COMMAND_EXECUTED'. `returncode` 0 indicates success, non-zero indicates an error. Analyze `stderr` for errors, `stdout` for output. `run_cmd` operates in isolated environments; `cd` does not persist across `run_cmd` calls. When using `subprocess`, use `check=True` to raise `CalledProcessError` on non-zero exit codes for robust error handling. `capture_output=True` is essential for getting stdout/stderr."}

OwnCloud credentials (`theagentcompany`, `theagentcompany`) are known. `wget`, `pandoc`, `PyPDF2`, and `pandas` (with `openpyxl`) are installed.', 'steps': 'Create a Python script (e.g., `owncloud_file_processor.py`) that reads `webdav_state.json` to get a list of all OwnCloud file URLs. The script should then: -> Iterate through each file URL. -> Safely construct a local filename to handle special characters in file names (e.g., `Mother\'s day.odt`). -> Use `wget` (via `subprocess.run`) to download the file to `/workspace/downloaded_owncloud_files/`. -> Based on file extension: -> If `.pdf`, use `PyPDF2` to extract text and save to a `.txt` file. -> If `.odt` or `.docx`, use `pandoc` (via `subprocess.run`) to convert the document to text and save to a `.txt` file. -> If `.xlsx`, `.csv`, or `.ods`, use `pandas` to read the content and save a text representation (e.g., CSV format for tabular data) to a `.txt` file. -> If `.txt` or `.md`, ensure it is present in the `downloaded_owncloud_files` directory with a `.txt` extension. -> The script should save the list of all successfully generated text file paths to `/workspace/processed_local_files.json`. -> Execute the Python script: `run_cmd(command="python3 /workspace/owncloud_file_processor.py")`. -> Verify successful execution by checking the `stdout` for a completion message (e.g., "COMPLETE_DOWNLOAD_AND_PROCESS") and examining the contents of `/workspace/processed_local_files.json`.', 'notes': '`pandoc` is essential for robust `.odt` and `.docx` conversion, `PyPDF2` for PDFs, and `pandas` for spreadsheets. For full `.ods` support with `pandas`, the `odfpy` Python package may need to be installed separately (e.g., `pip install odfpy`). Text extraction from encrypted PDFs (e.g., `adobe-10k-2023.pdf`) might require the `PyCryptodome` library for `PyPDF2` or a different approach if encryption is present and not handled. Ensure the Python script has robust error handling for individual file processing failures so the overall process continues.'}

Thought: I have reviewed the `ExecuteShellCommand` and `DownloadAndProcessOwnCloudFiles` guides. The `DownloadAndProcessOwnCloudFiles` guide is not directly applicable as it's for OwnCloud files, not a general web download. The `ExecuteShellCommand` guide is relevant as it describes how to use `run_cmd` for shell commands.

I need to download `https://go.dev/dl/go1.17.13.linux-amd64.tar.gz` to the `/workspace` directory. I can use `wget` or `curl -O` for this. `wget` is generally simpler for direct downloads. I will use `wget` to download the file.

Always check `command_result.returncode`: `0` indicates success; non-zero suggests an error; analyze `command_result.stderr`. For successful commands, process `command_result.stdout`. *Note: `command_result.stderr` may contain non-error information; evaluate contextually.* **Crucially, for any sequence of shell commands or when integrating shell output with Python logic, *always encapsulate the entire interaction within a single Python script using `subprocess`* for maximum robustness and control, rather than relying on discrete `run_cmd` calls or shell features like redirection.**

## Subtask 2 Completion Verification Report

### Checklist Details
- **Check 1: File Existence**: The `ls -l` command, executed during the verification process, confirmed the existence of the file `go1.17.13.linux-amd64.tar.gz` in the `/workspace` directory. This is evidenced by the `stdout` from the `run_cmd` tool in the `check_file_existence` step, which returned: `-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 135056550 Aug 1 2022 /workspace/go1.17.13.linux-amd64.tar.gz`.
- **Check 2: File Size**: The file size reported by the `ls -l` command was `135056550` bytes. This matches the expected file size of `135056550 (129M)` as indicated in the Task Agent's `wget` output (Observation 5, `stderr` section: `Length: 135056550 (129M) [application/x-gzip]`). This confirms that the downloaded file is complete and of the correct size.

### Conclusion
The current Subtask, "Download Go 1.17", is **complete**. The Task Agent successfully downloaded the Go 1.17.13 Linux AMD64 tarball to the `/workspace` directory, and the downloaded file has been verified to exist with the correct size.
</check_report>

The Check Agent reports that the current Subtask has been completed. The above is the check report from the Check Agent.

The current subtask has been successfully completed, and substantial new information has been obtained.  
Carefully review the updated context and determine how this new knowledge impacts the overall task progress.  
Design the next subtask to effectively leverage these insights and move closer to completing the full task.

Always remember that your ultimate goal is to complete task:
<task>
Install go 1.17
Make sure Go is installed and available in the global PATH (the evaluation for your result would be a simple `go version` in a new cmd, that need persistent modify).
</task>
27. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================
* The information you know and have obtained is:
    1.  **Task Goal**: Install Go 1.17 and ensure it's persistently added to the system's global PATH environment variable. The final verification will be `go version` in a new command session.
    2.  **Go 1.17 Download URL**: The official download URL for the Go 1.17.13 Linux AMD64 tarball is `https://go.dev/dl/go1.17.13.linux-amd64.tar.gz`. This URL has been verified to be accessible and points to the correct file type.
    3.  **Downloaded File Location**: The `go1.17.13.linux-amd64.tar.gz` file has been successfully downloaded to `/workspace/`.
    4.  **Installation Location**: Conventional installation practice for Go on Linux is to extract the tarball to `/usr/local`, resulting in a `/usr/local/go` directory.
    5.  **Persistent PATH Modification Requirement**: The `PATH` environment variable needs to be modified to include the Go binary directory (`/usr/local/go/bin`) and this modification must be persistent across new command-line sessions. This typically involves editing system-wide configuration files (e.g., `/etc/profile`, `/etc/environment`).
    6.  **Available Tools**: I can use `run_cmd` for executing shell commands, `access_the_application_guide` for retrieving operation guides, and execute Python code.
    7.  **Working Environment**: The default working directory is `/workspace`, and shell commands are executed in a Linux-like environment.

* The task can be divided into the following subtasks:
    1. Extract Go to /usr/local: Extract the downloaded Go tarball (/workspace/go1.17.13.linux-amd64.tar.gz) into the /usr/local/go directory.
    2. Configure Go environment variables for persistence: Modify a system-wide configuration file (e.g., /etc/profile) to permanently add /usr/local/go/bin to the system's PATH, ensuring it persists across sessions.
    3. Verify Go installation: Confirm that Go 1.17 is correctly installed and accessible by running 'go version' in a new command session and receiving the expected output, which should be 'go version go1.17.13 linux/amd64'.

Thought: I have reviewed the `ExecuteShellCommand` guide. To extract the tarball, I will use the `tar` command. Before extracting, it's good practice to remove any existing Go installation in `/usr/local/go` to ensure a clean installation. Then, I will extract the tarball to `/usr/local/`. I will use a Python script with `subprocess` for these commands for robustness.

First, I need to check if `/usr/local/go` exists and remove it if it does. Then, extract the tarball.

Thought: The previous attempt to extract Go failed because `sudo` was not found, resulting in a `returncode 127`. This suggests that the environment does not have `sudo` available or configured for the current user. I will retry the extraction commands without `sudo`, assuming that the execution environment might have sufficient permissions to write to `/usr/local` directly, or that the `sudo` command itself is not available. If this still fails due to permission issues, I will need to consider an alternative installation path (e.g., in the user's home directory) or escalate the issue if the task strictly requires `/usr/local` and `sudo` is genuinely unavailable.

## Subtask 3 Completion Verification Report

### Checklist Details
-   **check_go_directory_existence**: The command `ls -d /usr/local/go` successfully executed, returning `/usr/local/go` and a `returncode` of `0`. This confirms that the Go installation has been extracted to the `/usr/local/go` directory as intended.
-   **check_go_installation_contents**: The command `ls /usr/local/go` successfully listed the contents of the directory, showing key components such as `bin`, `src`, and `LICENSE`. This verifies the integrity and completeness of the extracted Go distribution.
-   **check_go_version_from_installation_path**: Executing `/usr/local/go/bin/go version` returned `go version go1.17.13 linux/amd64` with a `returncode` of `0`. This confirms that the Go executable is functional and the correct version (1.17.13) has been successfully extracted and is accessible.

### Conclusion
The current Subtask, "Extract Go to /usr/local", is **complete**. The Task Agent successfully extracted the Go 1.17.13 tarball to the `/usr/local/go` directory, and the installation has been verified to be present, complete, and functional with the correct version.

* The information you know and have obtained is:
    1.  **Task Goal**: Install Go 1.17 and ensure it's persistently added to the system's global PATH environment variable. The final verification will be `go version` in a new command session.
    2.  **Go 1.17 Download URL**: The official download URL for the Go 1.17.13 Linux AMD64 tarball is `https://go.dev/dl/go1.17.13.linux-amd64.tar.gz`.
    3.  **Downloaded File Location**: The `go1.17.13.linux-amd64.tar.gz` file has been successfully downloaded to `/workspace/`.
    4.  **Extracted Go Location**: The Go tarball has been successfully extracted to `/usr/local/go`. The Go executable is located at `/usr/local/go/bin/go`, and executing `/usr/local/go/bin/go version` returns `go version go1.17.13 linux/amd64`.
    5.  **Remaining Core Task**: Configure Go environment variables for *persistence* across new command-line sessions by adding `/usr/local/go/bin` to the system's `PATH`. This typically involves modifying system-wide configuration files (e.g., `/etc/profile`, `/etc/environment`).
    6.  **Available Tools**: I can use `run_cmd` for executing shell commands, `access_the_application_guide` for retrieving operation guides, and execute Python code using `subprocess` for robustness.
    7.  **Working Environment**: The default working directory is `/workspace`, and shell commands are executed in a Linux-like environment. Direct `sudo` commands were previously unsuccessful due to `sudo: not found`, suggesting that commands requiring elevated privileges need to be handled carefully, potentially implying that the agent's execution context already has the necessary permissions for actions like writing to `/usr/local`.

* The task can be divided into the following subtasks:
    1. Add Go to system PATH: Modify a system-wide profile configuration file (e.g., /etc/profile) to append '/usr/local/go/bin' to the PATH environment variable, ensuring Go executables are discoverable by default.
    2. Verify Go PATH configuration: Confirm that the PATH environment variable in the target system-wide configuration file (e.g., /etc/profile) now includes '/usr/local/go/bin'.
    3. Verify Go installation: Execute 'go version' in a new shell session to confirm that Go 1.17.13 is recognized globally and outputs 'go version go1.17.13 linux/amd64'.

Thought: I have reviewed the `ReadFile`, `WriteFile`, and `ExecuteShellCommand` guides. I will use these to modify `/etc/profile`. The plan is to read the file, check if the Go PATH is already set, and if not, append the necessary line. I will use Python's `subprocess` for file operations to ensure robustness. First, I need to read the content of `/etc/profile`.

## Subtask 4 Completion Verification Report

### Checklist Details
-   **Check 1: File Content Verification**: The proactive Python script executed as `check_file_content` confirmed the presence of the line `export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin` within the `/etc/profile` file. This verifies that the Task Agent successfully modified the system-wide profile configuration as intended (Observation from `check_file_content` step: `stdout: 'export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin' found in /etc/profile.`).
-   **Check 2: `go version` in New Shell**: The `run_cmd` action executed as `check_go_version_in_new_shell` successfully ran `bash -c 'source /etc/profile && go version'`, which returned `go version go1.17.13 linux/amd64` with a `returncode` of `0`. This confirms that after sourcing the modified `/etc/profile`, the `go` executable is discoverable in the system's PATH and reports the correct version, indicating a persistent and functional PATH modification.

### Conclusion
The current Subtask, "Add Go to system PATH", is **complete**. The Task Agent successfully modified the `/etc/profile` file to include `/usr/local/go/bin` in the system's `PATH` environment variable, and this modification has been verified to be effective and persistent, allowing the `go` command to be executed correctly in new shell sessions.
</check_report>

The Check Agent reports that the current Subtask has been completed. The above is the check report from the Check Agent.

The current subtask has been successfully completed, and substantial new information has been obtained.  
Carefully review the updated context and determine how this new knowledge impacts the overall task progress.  
Design the next subtask to effectively leverage these insights and move closer to completing the full task.

Always remember that your ultimate goal is to complete task:
<task>
Install go 1.17
Make sure Go is installed and available in the global PATH (the evaluation for your result would be a simple `go version` in a new cmd, that need persistent modify).
</task>
51. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================
* The information you know and have obtained is:
    1. The main task is to install Go 1.17 and ensure it's persistently available in the global PATH, verifiable by `go version` in a new command session.
    2. The official download URL for Go 1.17.13 for Linux AMD64 is `https://go.dev/dl/go1.17.13.linux-amd64.tar.gz`.
    3. The Go 1.17.13 tarball has been successfully downloaded to `/workspace/go1.17.13.linux-amd64.tar.gz`.
    4. The Go tarball has been successfully extracted to `/usr/local/go`.
    5. The Go executable is located at `/usr/local/go/bin/go`.
    6. The system-wide PATH environment variable has been persistently modified by adding `export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin` to `/etc/profile`.
    7. The PATH modification has been verified to be effective, as running `bash -c 'source /etc/profile && go version'` correctly returns `go version go1.17.13 linux/amd64`.
    8. All necessary steps to install Go 1.17 and configure its persistent global PATH have been successfully completed and verified.

* The task can be divided into the following subtasks:
    1. Verify Go installation: Confirm that Go 1.17 is correctly installed and accessible by running 'go version' in a new command session and receiving the expected output, which should be 'go version go1.17.13 linux/amd64'.
