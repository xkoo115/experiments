</tools>

2. **Python Code Execution**
When executing Python code, please output:
<code>
... your code ...
</code>
- The working directory is `/workspace`
- Executing dangerous, destructive, or time-consuming code is prohibited.
- If both a **Tool Call** and **Python Code Execution** are included in the output, the tool call takes precedence, and the Python code will not be executed.
- Using outdated or limited python libraries may result in incomplete or inaccurate observations (e.g. missing images from PDFs or failing to extract key content). Always prefer robust, modern libraries to ensure full and reliable results.
- When performing file conversion or data extraction, always ensure **data integrity**. Verify that the structure, content, and critical fields of the source file are preserved in the output. Check row and column counts, headers, and key values before and after processing. **Avoid silent loss**, truncation, or unintended alteration of data.

## Action Execution Result Processing
- After each action is executed, an Observation is returned, which includes:
    1. `<tool_response>`: The result of the tool or code execution.
    2. `<tool_instruction>`: The instruction associated with a specific action, used to guide the next step or restrict subsequent behavior.
- **Note**: Do not fabricate observations.

## Security and Restrictions
- **Coding Actions (such as Python, CMD, etc.)**
    - Do not run high-risk operations that are large in code size or take a long time.
    - Do not execute code that could cause data loss, system damage, or irreversible changes.
    - Do not use the kill command with wildcards like * or other dangerous parameters that could result in a wide range of matches.
    - Prefer using the Python interpreter to execute code (safer and more efficient) rather than using the CMD tool.

> ⚠️ **Important**
> When your output contains content that fully conforms to the **Tool Call** or **Python Code Execution** format, the system will immediately parse, identify, and execute it as an **Action** without further confirmation and without reversal.
> Therefore, before outputting, always confirm that this is your **intended** action and fully assess the potential consequences and risks.
> If you are only using **quotes, demonstrations, or examples**, be sure to break the formatting or escape it to prevent the system from interpreting it as a real action.

# OBJECTIVE #
Your core objective is to independently and efficiently complete the tasks assigned to you by the company.


# MEMORY #
During previous tasks, you have accumulated the following reusable knowledge:

## Resolution Patterns
Comprehensive Contextualization: Systematically acquire and aggregate information from diverse, potentially unstructured sources, prioritizing local processing and cross-validation, to ensure a complete, coherent operational view and inform robust decisions.
Robust External Interaction: Prioritize stable, predictable interaction methods, such as structured APIs, and dynamically adapt strategies to ensure continuity and reliability with external systems despite their inconsistencies or volatility.
Adaptive Constraint Handling: When an objective is blocked by an unresolvable external constraint, acknowledge the limitation, perform necessary cleanup of partial artifacts, and adapt the strategy to proceed with viable data, avoiding unproductive retries.
Modular Resilient Design: Decompose operations into modular, decoupled units with explicit state management, to enhance predictability, isolate errors, improve maintainability, and ensure operational continuity.
Progressive Verification: Implement multi-stage validation, from granular checks within pipelines to comprehensive outcome validation, to localize errors, confirm system states, and ensure successful execution.

## Platform/Application Operation Guides
These guides summarize proven operation paths derived from past successful experiences.  
Each item is a structured reference designed to help you complete operations more quickly, accurately, and with reduced redundancy.

> This directory provides a comprehensive index of guides, compiling best practices and experience summaries for accomplishing various tasks.

### Recommended Usage Process
1. **Review the Guide First**  
   Before starting a task, browse the relevant entries in the directory to identify potentially useful guidance.  
2. **Targeted Access**  
   Use the `access_the_application_guide` tool to view detailed steps if necessary.  
3. **Reuse with Flexibility**  
   Apply past successful steps when they fit the current situation, but stay aware of possible mismatches.  
4. **Explore When Deviations Arise**  
   If the environment or results diverge from the guide, stop rigidly following it and explore alternative approaches through small, safe, and adaptive steps.

### Value of Guides
- Reduce task completion time by leveraging accumulated experience.  
- Lower error rates and avoid common pitfalls.  
- Ensure consistent, professional execution of tasks.  

### Guide Reliability & Adaptation
- Guides may be outdated, biased, or contain errors — they are “historical experience,” not absolute truth.  
- Use guides as starting points, not as strict rules.  
- When deviations or conflicts appear, **exit the guide and explore new paths** instead of persisting.  
- Record useful deviation points for later improvement of the guides.

</Login>
</Application>
</tool_response>
<tool_instruction>
After accessing, carefully read the guide content. Extract and adapt relevant steps, recognizing that guide information may be outdated or require UI verification. Always prioritize current browser state by performing `browser_wait_and_get_update()` immediately before attempting to follow guide steps.
</tool_instruction>

07. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================
Thought: The `Login` guide for RocketChat provides a clear sequence of steps: navigate to the URL, wait for updates, identify input fields and login button, input credentials, and click login. The `tool_instruction` emphasizes verifying element indices dynamically. I will start by navigating to the RocketChat URL.
Action:
<tool_call>
{"name": "browser_go_to_url", "arguments": {"url": "http://the-agent-company.com:3000/home"}}
</tool_call>
08. | ================================================== USER MESSAGE ==================================================
Observation: 
<tool_response>
Performed browser action: 🔗 Navigated to http://the-agent-company.com:3000/home
The updated browser page status is as follows:
<webpage accessibility tree>[SYSTEM INFO: History accessibility tree removed for brevity]</webpage accessibility tree>
<webpage interactive elements>[SYSTEM INFO: History interactive elements removed for brevity]</webpage interactive elements>

</tool_response>
<tool_instruction>
Always inspect the `webpage accessibility tree` and `webpage interactive elements` after navigation to confirm the page loaded as expected. This step is crucial for verifying successful navigation and for preparing for subsequent interactions by ensuring the browser state is as anticipated.
</tool_instruction>

09. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================
Thought: The browser has successfully navigated to the RocketChat login page. I can see the "Email or username" and "Password" input fields, and a "Login" button in the `webpage interactive elements`. I need to input the credentials (`theagentcompany` for both username and password) and then click the login button.

Based on the `webpage interactive elements`:
- The username input field has `index: 6` and `placeholder: "Email or username"`.
- The password input field has `index: 8` and `placeholder: "Password"`.
- The login button has `index: 9` and `text: "<button >Login/>"`.

I will now input the username.
Action:
<tool_call>
{"name": "browser_input_text", "arguments": {"index": 6, "text": "theagentcompany"}}
</tool_call>
10. | ================================================== USER MESSAGE ==================================================
Observation:

<webpage accessibility tree>[SYSTEM INFO: History accessibility tree removed for brevity]</webpage accessibility tree>
<webpage interactive elements>[SYSTEM INFO: History interactive elements removed for brevity]</webpage interactive elements>

</tool_response>
<tool_instruction>
After inputting text, always use `browser_wait_and_get_update` to verify the text input, check for immediate validation feedback, or confirm any UI changes (e.g., enable/disable buttons, form submission readiness). Be especially mindful of index volatility, as UI changes can rapidly invalidate previously retrieved indices.
</tool_instruction>

Thought: I have successfully input and sent the message containing the password rules to Mark Johnson. The `webpage accessibility tree` in the observation clearly shows the message I sent, including all the rules, indicating that the message was successfully posted in the chat. Therefore, the subtask of communicating the password rules is complete.
Final Answer: Successfully sent the password rules to Mark Johnson.

The current subtask has been successfully completed, and substantial new information has been obtained.  
Carefully review the updated context and determine how this new knowledge impacts the overall task progress.  
Design the next subtask to effectively leverage these insights and move closer to completing the full task.

Always remember that your ultimate goal is to complete task:
<task>
You found that Mark Johnson's password doesn't follow the password rules, so you need to go to rocketchat to recieve a valid password from him. When you have a valid password, write it in a local file called `password.txt` under /workspace directory.

The password rules are as follows:
1. Length must be between 12-16 characters
2. Must contain at least one uppercase letter
3. Must contain at least one lowercase letter
4. Must contain at least one number
5. Must contain at least one special character from: !@#$%^&*
6. Cannot contain 3 or more consecutive identical characters
7. Cannot contain the user's name as part of the password

The message content will be:
"Hi Mark, your suggested password 'mark_johnson123' is not valid because:
- It does not contain at least one uppercase letter.
- It does not contain at least one special character from: !@#$%^&*.
- It contains your name ('mark_johnson') as part of the password.

Thought: I have accessed the `SendMessage` guide. I need to send a message to Mark Johnson explaining why his password "mj123" is invalid. I will list the specific rules it failed and ask him to provide a new one. I will use `browser_wait_and_get_update()` to get the current page state, then `browser_input_text()` to type the message, and `browser_send_keys("Enter")` to send it.

The message content will be:
"Hi Mark, your latest password suggestion 'mj123' is also not valid because:
- Its length is 5 characters, but it must be between 12-16 characters.
- It does not contain at least one uppercase letter.
- It does not contain at least one special character from: !@#$%^&*.
Please provide a new password that follows all the rules."

I will first get the latest interactive elements to ensure the index for the message input field is correct.

If not already in the target channel or direct message, use `RocketChat: AccessConversation` or `Browser: NavigateToURL` (if the exact channel/DM URL is known, e.g., `http://the-agent-company.com:3000/channel/literaturereview`) to navigate there first. If an obstructing sidebar (e.g., channel details) is open, it may need to be closed first (e.g., via `Browser: DismissOverlay`). Replace `<message_content>` with the actual message. Successful sending verified by observing `webpage accessibility tree` for the presence of a `paragraph` element containing the message content, typically preceded by `StaticText` for the sender username (e.g., `StaticText 'theagentcompany'`) and a timestamp (e.g., `StaticText '10:28 PM'`). The message input field should also appear cleared after successful sending. For replies, allow additional time for `browser_wait_and_get_update()` (e.g., 5-10 seconds) then analyze `webpage accessibility tree`."}

After accessing, carefully read the guide content. Extract and adapt relevant steps, recognizing that guide information may be outdated or require UI verification. Always prioritize current browser state by performing `browser_wait_and_get_update()` immediately before attempting to follow guide steps.

137. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================
Thought: I have accessed the `SendMessage` guide. I need to send a message to Mark Johnson confirming that the provided password "Fl0w3r#Br1ght" is valid. I will use `browser_wait_and_get_update()` to get the current page state, then `browser_input_text()` to type the message, and `browser_send_keys("Enter")` to send it.

The message content will be:
"Hi Mark, thank you! The password 'Fl0w3r#Br1ght' is valid and meets all the criteria."

I will first get the latest interactive elements to ensure the index for the message input field is correct.
