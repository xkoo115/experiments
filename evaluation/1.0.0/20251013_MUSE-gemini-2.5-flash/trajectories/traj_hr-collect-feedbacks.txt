# ACTION #
During task execution, you can perform **Actions**, including:
1. **Tool Call**
2. **Python Code Execution**

## Action Output Format
1. **Tool Call**
When calling a tool, please output:
<tool_call>
{"name": "<function-name>", "arguments": <args-json-object>}
</tool_call>
- `<function-name>`: Tool function name
- `<args-json-object>`: Call arguments (JSON format)
- If multiple `<tool_call>` are output at once, only the first one will be executed; the rest will be ignored.

Available tool signatures are provided within the `<tools>` tag:
<tools>
{"type": "function", "function": {"name": "extract_image_content_by_gpt4o", "description": "Utilizes `gpt-4o` to interpret and extract content from local image files (e.g., PNG, JPEG). Highly effective for **scanned documents, image-based PDFs (post-conversion to image formats),** or visual data. For optimal extraction, craft precise queries. **Caution: While effective for general content, direct numerical or highly structured extraction from complex visual elements (e.g., tally marks, handwritten notes) may be imprecise; robust post-processing is often required. For multi-page documents, convert each page into a separate image and ensure *all* generated image pages are processed for complete data extraction.**", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"image_path": {"type": "string", "description": "Local image path."}, "query": {"type": "string", "description": "Query to the gpt-4o to get the image content."}}, "required": ["image_path", "query"]}}}

Element indices are dynamic and highly volatile; always verify the target element's existence and index using `browser_wait_and_get_update` immediately before clicking. Be aware that even with immediate updates, indices can shift in very dynamic UIs. Crucially, after clicking, always use `browser_wait_and_get_update` to immediately re-evaluate the page state and confirm the intended effect (e.g., UI changes, navigation). For navigation, `browser_go_to_url` is a more robust alternative when a direct URL is known. For form submissions or general action triggers, `browser_send_keys` with 'Enter' is often a more robust alternative, especially when direct clicking by index proves unreliable. Avoid clicking elements that are not currently visible or interactable.", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"index": {"type": "integer", "description": "The index number of the target element."}}, "required": ["index"]}}}

It cannot process content that is scrolled out of view or exists on other pages of a paginated list. While `accessibility tree` and `interactive elements` are primary for UI understanding, this visual tool can be a highly effective *primary* method for text extraction in challenging scenarios. **Crucially, for critical or structured data (e.g., IDs, specific names, numerical values), always cross-verify with or prefer extraction from the `webpage accessibility tree` as visual interpretation may introduce inaccuracies, especially for abbreviated or visually ambiguous elements.**", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"query": {"type": "string", "description": "Query to the VL model to get the browser page content."}}, "required": ["query"]}}}

The `webpage interactive elements` from its output are highly dynamic and should be used immediately. For verifying responses or dynamic updates, consider setting `seconds` to a value appropriate for expected latency (e.g., `seconds=1` for immediate state, longer for human-like response times). **This tool is a fundamental prerequisite for almost all subsequent browser interactions due to the highly dynamic nature of web UI element indices.**", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"seconds": {"type": "integer", "description": "The number of seconds to wait, the default is 3 seconds.", "default": 3}}, "required": []}}}

Returns a JSON object with `execution_status`, `returncode`, `stdout`, and `stderr`. **Important Precautions**: 1) `returncode=0` does not guarantee successful side effects (e.g., file creation); always verify with independent checks (`ls -l`, `file`). 2) **This tool executes commands in a *minimal* shell environment. Complex shell features like command chaining (`&&`, `||`), pipes (`|`), I/O redirection (`>`, `>>`), and backgrounding (`&`) are often *not reliably interpreted by `run_cmd` directly* and can lead to unexpected behavior or errors (e.g., `SyntaxError`, `command not found`). For any non-trivial shell interaction or complex logic, *always prefer consolidating operations into a single Python script that uses `subprocess` for explicit control and robustness* over multiple `run_cmd` calls or complex shell syntax.** 3) Quote arguments containing spaces (`\"path with spaces\"`). 4) State changes (`cd`) do not persist across calls.", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"command": {"type": "string", "description": "command暂时没有参数描述"}}, "required": ["command"]}}}
</tools>

2. **Python Code Execution**
When executing Python code, please output:
<code>
... your code ...
</code>
- The working directory is `/workspace`
- Executing dangerous, destructive, or time-consuming code is prohibited.
- If both a **Tool Call** and **Python Code Execution** are included in the output, the tool call takes precedence, and the Python code will not be executed.
- Using outdated or limited python libraries may result in incomplete or inaccurate observations (e.g. missing images from PDFs or failing to extract key content). Always prefer robust, modern libraries to ensure full and reliable results.
- When performing file conversion or data extraction, always ensure **data integrity**. Verify that the structure, content, and critical fields of the source file are preserved in the output. Check row and column counts, headers, and key values before and after processing. **Avoid silent loss**, truncation, or unintended alteration of data.

## Action Execution Result Processing
- After each action is executed, an Observation is returned, which includes:
    1. `<tool_response>`: The result of the tool or code execution.
    2. `<tool_instruction>`: The instruction associated with a specific action, used to guide the next step or restrict subsequent behavior.
- **Note**: Do not fabricate observations.

## Security and Restrictions
- **Coding Actions (such as Python, CMD, etc.)**
    - Do not run high-risk operations that are large in code size or take a long time.
    - Do not execute code that could cause data loss, system damage, or irreversible changes.
    - Do not use the kill command with wildcards like * or other dangerous parameters that could result in a wide range of matches.
    - Prefer using the Python interpreter to execute code (safer and more efficient) rather than using the CMD tool.

> ⚠️ **Important**
> When your output contains content that fully conforms to the **Tool Call** or **Python Code Execution** format, the system will immediately parse, identify, and execute it as an **Action** without further confirmation and without reversal.
> Therefore, before outputting, always confirm that this is your **intended** action and fully assess the potential consequences and risks.
> If you are only using **quotes, demonstrations, or examples**, be sure to break the formatting or escape it to prevent the system from interpreting it as a real action.

# OBJECTIVE #
Your core objective is to independently and efficiently complete the tasks assigned to you by the company.


# MEMORY #
During previous tasks, you have accumulated the following reusable knowledge:

## Resolution Patterns
Comprehensive Contextualization: Systematically acquire and aggregate information from diverse, potentially unstructured sources, prioritizing local processing and cross-validation, to ensure a complete, coherent operational view and inform robust decisions.
Robust External Interaction: Prioritize stable, predictable interaction methods, such as structured APIs, and dynamically adapt strategies to ensure continuity and reliability with external systems despite their inconsistencies or volatility.
Adaptive Constraint Handling: When an objective is blocked by an unresolvable external constraint, acknowledge the limitation, perform necessary cleanup of partial artifacts, and adapt the strategy to proceed with viable data, avoiding unproductive retries.
Modular Resilient Design: Decompose operations into modular, decoupled units with explicit state management, to enhance predictability, isolate errors, improve maintainability, and ensure operational continuity.
Progressive Verification: Implement multi-stage validation, from granular checks within pipelines to comprehensive outcome validation, to localize errors, confirm system states, and ensure successful execution.

## Platform/Application Operation Guides
These guides summarize proven operation paths derived from past successful experiences.  
Each item is a structured reference designed to help you complete operations more quickly, accurately, and with reduced redundancy.

> This directory provides a comprehensive index of guides, compiling best practices and experience summaries for accomplishing various tasks.

### Recommended Usage Process
1. **Review the Guide First**  
   Before starting a task, browse the relevant entries in the directory to identify potentially useful guidance.  
2. **Targeted Access**  
   Use the `access_the_application_guide` tool to view detailed steps if necessary.  
3. **Reuse with Flexibility**  
   Apply past successful steps when they fit the current situation, but stay aware of possible mismatches.  
4. **Explore When Deviations Arise**  
   If the environment or results diverge from the guide, stop rigidly following it and explore alternative approaches through small, safe, and adaptive steps.

### Value of Guides
- Reduce task completion time by leveraging accumulated experience.  
- Lower error rates and avoid common pitfalls.  
- Ensure consistent, professional execution of tasks.  

### Guide Reliability & Adaptation
- Guides may be outdated, biased, or contain errors — they are “historical experience,” not absolute truth.  
- Use guides as starting points, not as strict rules.  
- When deviations or conflicts appear, **exit the guide and explore new paths** instead of persisting.  
- Record useful deviation points for later improvement of the guides.

### Task Verification Report

**Title**: Subtask Completion Verification: LoginToRocketChat

**Checklist Details**:

1.  **Verify_Post_Login_UI**:
    *   **Goal**: Confirm the presence of elements indicative of a successful RocketChat login (e.g., 'Home', 'Search', 'Channels' section) within the browser's accessibility tree or interactive elements.
    *   **Verification**:
        *   Observation 11's `<webpage accessibility tree>` clearly shows the presence of:
            *   `button 'Home'`
            *   `button 'Search'`
            *   `region 'Channels'`
        *   These elements are characteristic of the RocketChat dashboard and confirm a successful transition from the login page.
    *   **Status**: PASSED

2.  **Verify_Absence_of_Login_Form**:
    *   **Goal**: Confirm the absence of login form elements (e.g., username/password input fields, 'Login' button) within the browser's interactive elements, indicating the transition away from the login page.
    *   **Verification**:
        *   In Observation 5, prior to login, the `<webpage interactive elements>` explicitly listed:
            *   `"index": 6, "tag": "input", ... "placeholder": "Email or username"`
            *   `"index": 8, "tag": "input", ... "placeholder": "Password"`
            *   `"index": 9, "tag": "button", ... "text": "<button >Login/>"`
        *   In Observation 11, after the login attempt, these specific interactive elements (indices 6, 8, and 9 with their respective placeholder/text attributes) are no longer present in the `<webpage interactive elements>` list.
    *   **Status**: PASSED

**Conclusion**:
Based on the successful verification of both the presence of post-login UI elements and the absence of pre-login form elements, the Subtask "LoginToRocketChat" has been successfully completed by the Task Agent. The agent has successfully navigated to and logged into the RocketChat application.

Replace `<target_name>` with the actual username or channel name. For channels, the search bar generally works with or without the '#' prefix. Successful navigation is verified by inspecting the `webpage accessibility tree` for the correct chat heading (e.g., `heading '<target_name>'`) and URL (e.g., `http://the-agent-company.com:3000/direct/<user_id>` or `http://the-agent-company.com:3000/channel/<channel_name>`).

### Task Verification Report

**Title**: Subtask Completion Verification: AccessDirectMessages

**Checklist Details**:

1.  **Verify_Search_Input_Field_Presence**:
    *   **Goal**: Confirm that a search input field, indicative of a direct messaging search interface, is present on the page following the click action.
    *   **Verification**: Observation 7's `<webpage interactive elements>` clearly shows the presence of an interactive input element: `{"index": 4, "tag": "input", "text": "<input type=text placeholder=Search (\u2303+K)/>", "placeholder": "Search (⌘+K)"}`. This element signifies the successful appearance of a search input field.
    *   **Status**: PASSED

2.  **Verify_Search_Input_Field_Interactability**:
    *   **Goal**: Ensure the identified search input field is not only present but also interactable (e.g., editable and focused), allowing for user input to search for individuals.
    *   **Verification**: Observation 7's `<webpage accessibility tree>` for the relevant `textbox` element within the `search` role explicitly includes attributes `focusable=True`, `focused=True`, and `editable='plaintext'`. These attributes confirm that the input field is fully interactable and ready to receive text.
    *   **Status**: PASSED

3.  **Verify_Current_URL_Unchanged**:
    *   **Goal**: Confirm that clicking the 'Search' button did not change the browser's URL, indicating that the search interface likely appeared as an overlay or modal, maintaining the user's context on the home page.
    *   **Verification**: The `url` attribute of the `RootWebArea` in both Observation 5 (before the click) and Observation 7 (after the click) remained consistently `http://the-agent-company.com:3000/home`. This demonstrates that the search interface appeared without navigating away from the current page.
    *   **Status**: PASSED

**Conclusion**:
Based on the successful verification that a search input field is present, interactable, and appeared without changing the URL, the Subtask "AccessDirectMessages" has been successfully completed by the Task Agent. The agent has successfully accessed the direct messaging interface, which is now ready for user input.

### Task Verification Report

**Title**: Subtask Completion Verification: ConsolidateFeedback

**Checklist Details**:

1.  **Verify_Input_Feedback_Accuracy**:
    *   **Goal**: Confirm that the feedback strings used by the Task Agent in the Python script precisely match the feedback content identified and stored during the completion of the respective previous subtasks.
    *   **Verification**: The `mike_chen_feedback`, `li_ming_feedback`, and `zhang_wei_feedback` variables in the Python code in Observation 2 were compared against the feedback content verified in the `done_subtasks` reports for 'AskMikeChenForFeedback', 'AskLiMingForFeedback', and 'AskZhangWeiForFeedback'. All three feedback strings were found to be an exact match to the previously recorded content.
    *   **Status**: PASSED

2.  **Verify_Sentiment_Analysis_Logic**:
    *   **Goal**: Manually apply the Task Agent's defined keyword-based sentiment analysis logic to each individual feedback string to confirm that the agent's implicit individual sentiment categorization is correct according to its own logic.
    *   **Verification**:
        *   Mike Chen's feedback (Observation 2) contained positive keywords ("impressed", "excellent job", "doing great work") matching the agent's positive `if` condition.
        *   Li Ming's feedback (Observation 2) contained negative keywords ("not been up to par", "slacking off", "affecting the team's productivity") matching the agent's negative `elif` condition.
        *   Zhang Wei's feedback (Observation 2) contained positive keywords ("outstanding job", "top-notch", "real asset", "significantly improved") matching the agent's positive `if` condition.
        *   The `positive_count` would be 2 and `negative_count` would be 1, consistent with the agent's logic.
    *   **Status**: PASSED

3.  **Verify_Overall_Categorization_Logic**:
    *   **Goal**: Based on the verified individual sentiment counts, manually apply the Task Agent's overall performance categorization logic to determine if the `overall_performance` result is logically consistent.
    *   **Verification**: With `positive_count = 2` and `negative_count = 1` (from 3 total feedbacks), applying the agent's logic from Observation 2:
        *   `if positive_count == len(feedbacks)` (2 == 3) is False.
        *   `elif negative_count == len(feedbacks)` (1 == 3) is False.
        *   Therefore, the `else` block correctly yields "mixed" for `overall_performance`.
    *   **Status**: PASSED

4.  **Verify_Output_Consistency**:
    *   **Goal**: Confirm that the 'overall performance' reported in the `stdout` of the Python script execution and the Task Agent's `Final Answer` are consistent with the `overall_performance` determined by the applied logic in the previous verification step.
    *   **Verification**:
        *   The `overall_performance` derived from manual logic application was "mixed".
        *   The `stdout` in Observation 3 explicitly reported: "Overall performance for Liu Qiang: mixed".
        *   The Task Agent's `Final Answer` in Observation 4 stated: "The overall performance for Liu Qiang is categorized as "mixed"".
        *   All are consistent.
    *   **Status**: PASSED

**Conclusion**:
All verification checks have passed. The Task Agent accurately incorporated the correct feedback, applied its defined sentiment analysis logic correctly to individual feedbacks, correctly aggregated these into appropriate counts, and finally applied the overall categorization logic to arrive at the consistent "mixed" performance assessment. Therefore, Subtask "ConsolidateFeedback" is considered complete.

Goal: The performance review message, formulated based on the consolidated 'mixed' feedback, has been successfully delivered to Liu Qiang via direct message in RocketChat.
109. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================
Thought: I need to deliver the performance review message to Liu Qiang. This involves finding Liu Qiang in RocketChat, opening a direct message conversation with him, and then sending the prepared message. The relevant guides in the `Platform/Application Operation Guide Directory` would be "AccessConversation" and "SendMessage" under "RocketChat".

Replace `<target_name>` with the actual username or channel name. For channels, the search bar generally works with or without the '#' prefix. Successful navigation is verified by inspecting the `webpage accessibility tree` for the correct chat heading (e.g., `heading '<target_name>'`) and URL (e.g., `http://the-agent-company.com:3000/direct/<user_id>` or `http://the-agent-company.com:3000/channel/<channel_name>`).

If an obstructing sidebar (e.g., channel details) is open, it may need to be closed first (e.g., via `Browser: DismissOverlay`). Replace `<message_content>` with the actual message. Successful sending verified by observing `webpage accessibility tree` for the presence of a `paragraph` element containing the message content, typically preceded by `StaticText` for the sender username (e.g., `StaticText 'theagentcompany'`) and a timestamp (e.g., `StaticText '10:28 PM'`).

### Task Verification Report

**Title**: Subtask Completion Verification: DeliverPerformanceReviewToLiuQiang

**Checklist Details**:

1.  **Verify_LiuQiang_Chat_Accessible**:
    *   **Goal**: Confirm that the current browser URL and page heading indicate successful navigation to Liu Qiang's direct message conversation.
    *   **Verification**: Observation 11's `<webpage accessibility tree>` clearly shows `url='http://the-agent-company.com:3000/direct/CZYWHd5bCmhj5YcFeGYMYHQKtWPAr47ZsE'` and a `heading 'liu_qiang', level=1`. Both indicate successful navigation to Liu Qiang's direct message chat.
    *   **Status**: PASSED

2.  **Verify_Message_Content_Input_Correctly**:
    *   **Goal**: Confirm that the performance review message was accurately input into the message field before being sent.
    *   **Verification**: The `browser_input_text` action in Observation 12 requested to input the specific performance review message. Observation 13's `<webpage accessibility tree>` shows the `textbox 'Message'` containing `StaticText "Hi Liu Qiang, regarding your performance last quarter, the feedback we've gathered indicates it was average. We encourage you to continue striving for improvement in the next quarter."`, and the `<webpage interactive elements>` list includes a `label` (index 87) with the exact same text. This confirms the message was accurately input.
    *   **Status**: PASSED

3.  **Verify_Message_Sent_And_Displayed**:
    *   **Goal**: Confirm that the message was successfully sent and is visibly present in the chat history, attributed to the sending user (theagentcompany).
    *   **Verification**: In Observation 15's `<webpage accessibility tree>`, a `paragraph` element containing the full performance review message (`"Hi Liu Qiang, regarding your performance last quarter, the feedback we've gathered indicates it was average. We encourage you to continue striving for improvement in the next quarter."`) is present. This paragraph is immediately preceded by `StaticText 'theagentcompany'` and a timestamp `StaticText '6:58 PM'`, confirming that the message was sent and is displayed in the chat history by the correct sender.
    *   **Status**: PASSED

**Conclusion**:
All verification checks have passed. The Task Agent successfully navigated to Liu Qiang's direct message conversation, accurately input the performance review message, and successfully sent it, with the message appearing correctly in the chat history. Therefore, the Subtask "DeliverPerformanceReviewToLiuQiang" is considered complete.
