# ACTION #
During task execution, you can perform **Actions**, including:
1. **Tool Call**
2. **Python Code Execution**

## Action Output Format
1. **Tool Call**
When calling a tool, please output:
<tool_call>
{"name": "<function-name>", "arguments": <args-json-object>}
</tool_call>
- `<function-name>`: Tool function name
- `<args-json-object>`: Call arguments (JSON format)
- If multiple `<tool_call>` are output at once, only the first one will be executed; the rest will be ignored.

Available tool signatures are provided within the `<tools>` tag:
<tools>

Crucially, after clicking, always use `browser_wait_and_get_update` to immediately re-evaluate the page state and confirm the intended effect (e.g., UI changes, navigation). For navigation, `browser_go_to_url` is a more robust alternative when a direct URL is known. For form submissions or general action triggers, `browser_send_keys` with 'Enter' is often a more robust alternative, especially when direct clicking by index proves unreliable.

Returns a JSON object with `execution_status`, `returncode`, `stdout`, and `stderr`. **Important Precautions**: 1) `returncode=0` does not guarantee successful side effects (e.g., file creation); always verify with independent checks (`ls -l`, `file`). 2) **This tool executes commands in a *minimal* shell environment. Complex shell features like command chaining (`&&`, `||`), pipes (`|`), I/O redirection (`>`, `>>`), and backgrounding (`&`) are often *not reliably interpreted by `run_cmd` directly* and can lead to unexpected behavior or errors (e.g., `SyntaxError`, `command not found`). For any non-trivial shell interaction or complex logic, *always prefer consolidating operations into a single Python script that uses `subprocess` for explicit control and robustness* over multiple `run_cmd` calls or complex shell syntax.** 3) Quote arguments containing spaces (`\"path with spaces\"`). 4) State changes (`cd`) do not persist across calls.", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"command": {"type": "string", "description": "command暂时没有参数描述"}}, "required": ["command"]}}}
</tools>

2. **Python Code Execution**
When executing Python code, please output:
<code>
... your code ...
</code>
- The working directory is `/workspace`
- Executing dangerous, destructive, or time-consuming code is prohibited.
- If both a **Tool Call** and **Python Code Execution** are included in the output, the tool call takes precedence, and the Python code will not be executed.
- Using outdated or limited python libraries may result in incomplete or inaccurate observations (e.g. missing images from PDFs or failing to extract key content). Always prefer robust, modern libraries to ensure full and reliable results.
- When performing file conversion or data extraction, always ensure **data integrity**. Verify that the structure, content, and critical fields of the source file are preserved in the output. Check row and column counts, headers, and key values before and after processing. **Avoid silent loss**, truncation, or unintended alteration of data.

## Action Execution Result Processing
- After each action is executed, an Observation is returned, which includes:
    1. `<tool_response>`: The result of the tool or code execution.
    2. `<tool_instruction>`: The instruction associated with a specific action, used to guide the next step or restrict subsequent behavior.
- **Note**: Do not fabricate observations.

## Security and Restrictions
- **Coding Actions (such as Python, CMD, etc.)**
    - Do not run high-risk operations that are large in code size or take a long time.
    - Do not execute code that could cause data loss, system damage, or irreversible changes.
    - Do not use the kill command with wildcards like * or other dangerous parameters that could result in a wide range of matches.
    - Prefer using the Python interpreter to execute code (safer and more efficient) rather than using the CMD tool.

> ⚠️ **Important**
> When your output contains content that fully conforms to the **Tool Call** or **Python Code Execution** format, the system will immediately parse, identify, and execute it as an **Action** without further confirmation and without reversal.
> Therefore, before outputting, always confirm that this is your **intended** action and fully assess the potential consequences and risks.
> If you are only using **quotes, demonstrations, or examples**, be sure to break the formatting or escape it to prevent the system from interpreting it as a real action.

# OBJECTIVE #
Your core objective is to independently and efficiently complete the tasks assigned to you by the company.


# MEMORY #
During previous tasks, you have accumulated the following reusable knowledge:

## Resolution Patterns
Comprehensive Contextualization: Systematically acquire and aggregate information from diverse, potentially unstructured sources, prioritizing local processing and cross-validation, to ensure a complete, coherent operational view and inform robust decisions.
Robust External Interaction: Prioritize stable, predictable interaction methods, such as structured APIs, and dynamically adapt strategies to ensure continuity and reliability with external systems despite their inconsistencies or volatility.
Adaptive Constraint Handling: When an objective is blocked by an unresolvable external constraint, acknowledge the limitation, perform necessary cleanup of partial artifacts, and adapt the strategy to proceed with viable data, avoiding unproductive retries.
Modular Resilient Design: Decompose operations into modular, decoupled units with explicit state management, to enhance predictability, isolate errors, improve maintainability, and ensure operational continuity.
Progressive Verification: Implement multi-stage validation, from granular checks within pipelines to comprehensive outcome validation, to localize errors, confirm system states, and ensure successful execution.

## Platform/Application Operation Guides
These guides summarize proven operation paths derived from past successful experiences.  
Each item is a structured reference designed to help you complete operations more quickly, accurately, and with reduced redundancy.

> This directory provides a comprehensive index of guides, compiling best practices and experience summaries for accomplishing various tasks.

### Recommended Usage Process
1. **Review the Guide First**  
   Before starting a task, browse the relevant entries in the directory to identify potentially useful guidance.  
2. **Targeted Access**  
   Use the `access_the_application_guide` tool to view detailed steps if necessary.  
3. **Reuse with Flexibility**  
   Apply past successful steps when they fit the current situation, but stay aware of possible mismatches.  
4. **Explore When Deviations Arise**  
   If the environment or results diverge from the guide, stop rigidly following it and explore alternative approaches through small, safe, and adaptive steps.

### Value of Guides
- Reduce task completion time by leveraging accumulated experience.  
- Lower error rates and avoid common pitfalls.  
- Ensure consistent, professional execution of tasks.  

### Guide Reliability & Adaptation
- Guides may be outdated, biased, or contain errors — they are “historical experience,” not absolute truth.  
- Use guides as starting points, not as strict rules.  
- When deviations or conflicts appear, **exit the guide and explore new paths** instead of persisting.  
- Record useful deviation points for later improvement of the guides.

</Application>
</tool_response>
<tool_instruction>
After accessing, carefully read the guide content. Extract and adapt relevant steps, recognizing that guide information may be outdated or require UI verification. Always prioritize current browser state by performing `browser_wait_and_get_update()` immediately before attempting to follow guide steps.
</tool_instruction>

07. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================
Thought: The guide provides a clear set of steps for logging into RocketChat. I need to navigate to the URL, then identify the username, password fields, and the login button using `browser_wait_and_get_update()`, input the credentials, and click the login button. Finally, I will verify the login success.

First, I need to go to the RocketChat URL.
Action:
<tool_call>

Observation: 
<tool_response>
Performed browser action: 🔗 Navigated to http://the-agent-company.com:3000/home
The updated browser page status is as follows:
<webpage accessibility tree>[SYSTEM INFO: History accessibility tree removed for brevity]</webpage accessibility tree>
<webpage interactive elements>[SYSTEM INFO: History interactive elements removed for brevity]</webpage interactive elements>

</tool_response>
<tool_instruction>
Always inspect the `webpage accessibility tree` and `webpage interactive elements` after navigation to confirm the page loaded as expected. This step is crucial for verifying successful navigation and for preparing for subsequent interactions by ensuring the browser state is as anticipated.
</tool_instruction>

09. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================
Thought: The browser has successfully navigated to the RocketChat login page. I have identified the indices for the username input field (6), password input field (8), and login button (9). I will now proceed to input the credentials and click the login button.

<webpage accessibility tree>[SYSTEM INFO: History accessibility tree removed for brevity]</webpage accessibility tree>
<webpage interactive elements>[SYSTEM INFO: History interactive elements removed for brevity]</webpage interactive elements>

</tool_response>
<tool_instruction>
After inputting text, always use `browser_wait_and_get_update` to verify the text input, check for immediate validation feedback, or confirm any UI changes (e.g., enable/disable buttons, form submission readiness). Be especially mindful of index volatility, as UI changes can rapidly invalidate previously retrieved indices.
</tool_instruction>

<webpage interactive elements>[SYSTEM INFO: History interactive elements removed for brevity]</webpage interactive elements>

</tool_response>
<tool_instruction>
If an `Element index does not exist` error is returned, it indicates extreme element volatility. **Always re-evaluate `webpage interactive elements` with `browser_wait_and_get_update` immediately before attempting a click, and crucially, confirm the element's `text` or `aria-label` attribute semantically matches the intended target.** If direct clicking by index proves unreliable, *especially within dynamic lists or sidebars (e.g., chat contact lists)*, consider alternative strategies like using an application's built-in search functionality or `browser_go_to_url` if a direct link is known, rather than repeatedly retrying. For form submissions or general action triggers, `browser_send_keys` with 'Enter' is a more robust alternative and **highly recommended for reliability**.

Title: Subtask Completion Report - Login to RocketChat

Checklist Details:
- **Confirmation of RocketChat dashboard display**: The `webpage interactive elements` in Observation 11 shows the presence of dashboard elements such as `{"index": 4, "tag": "button", "text": "<button type=button title=Home>\ue043/>"}`, `{"index": 5, "tag": "button", "text": "<button type=button title=Search>\ue055/>"}`, `{"index": 6, "tag": "button", "text": "<button type=button title=Directory>\ue0ff/>"}`, `{"index": 7, "tag": "button", "text": "<button type=button title=Display>\ue074/>"}`, `{"index": 8, "tag": "button", "text": "<button type=button title=Create new>\ue027/>"}`, and `{"index": 9, "tag": "button", "text": "<button type=button title=Administration>\ue057/>"}`. Conversely, the login form fields (username input, password input, and login button) that were present in Observation 05 are no longer visible in Observation 11. This indicates a successful transition from the login page to the RocketChat dashboard.

Conclusion:
The Subtask "Login to RocketChat" is complete.

Title: Subtask Completion Report - Create public channel #finance-talk

Checklist Details:
- **Current URL verification**: The browser's URL in Observation 17 is `http://the-agent-company.com:3000/channel/finance-talk`, which precisely matches the expected URL for the newly created channel.
- **Channel header content**: The `webpage accessibility tree` in Observation 17 explicitly shows a `heading 'finance-talk', level=1` within the main 'Channel' section, confirming the channel name is displayed in the page header.
- **Channel presence in list**: The `webpage interactive elements` in Observation 17 contain an anchor tag `{"index": 14, "tag": "a", "text": "<a aria-label=finance-talk/>", "href": "/channel/finance-talk"}`, indicating the 'finance-talk' channel is now present in the channel list.
- **Public status confirmation**: Observation 15 demonstrates that after the agent clicked interactive element with index 8, the associated text changed from "Only invited users can access this Channel" to "Everyone can access this channel," and the 'Private' checkbox state became `checked='false'`. This confirms the channel was successfully set to public.

Conclusion:
The Subtask "A new public channel named '#finance-talk' is successfully created" is complete.

I need to click this option to select David Wong. The `webpage interactive elements` shows that the `div` element containing "David Wong" is part of the `listbox` at index 84. The `option` for "David Wong (david_wong)" is not directly clickable as an interactive element. I will try to click the `div` with `role=option` that contains "David Wong (david_wong)". This is at index 83. After selecting David Wong, I need to click the "Add users" button.

I need to re-evaluate the interactive elements to find the correct index for "David Wong (david_wong)" in the suggestion list. The `webpage interactive elements` shows `{"index": 83, "tag": "div", "text": "<div role=option/>"}` which is the parent of the David Wong option. I will try to click on the option itself. I will use `browser_wait_and_get_update` to get the latest interactive elements first.

Thought: I have successfully clicked the "Add users" button. The `webpage accessibility tree` in the observation shows "theagentcompany added david_wong", which confirms that David Wong has been successfully added to the channel.

Title: Subtask Completion Report - Invite David Wong to #finance-talk

Checklist Details:
- **Chat Notification for Member Addition**: The `webpage accessibility tree` in Observation 19 contains the specific `StaticText 'theagentcompany added david_wong'`. This directly confirms, as noted in the `ManageChannelMembersFromChat` guide (Observation 03), that David Wong has been successfully added to the #finance-talk channel.
- **Proactive Visual Check of Members List**: An additional `browser_extract_content_by_vision` action was performed (Observation 21). Although it initially reported "David Wong is not currently visible in the members list", the explanation clarified that "the members list is filtered to show only "Online" users" and confirmed that "the chat history clearly states, "theagentcompany added david_wong"". This indicates that David Wong is indeed a member but is not currently online, thereby not appearing in the filtered list. This visual check, combined with the chat notification, provides robust confirmation of the member addition.

Conclusion:
The Subtask "Invite David Wong to #finance-talk" is complete.

If an obstructing sidebar (e.g., channel details) is open, it may need to be closed first (e.g., via `Browser: DismissOverlay`). Replace `<message_content>` with the actual message. Successful sending verified by observing `webpage accessibility tree` for the presence of a `paragraph` element containing the message content, typically preceded by `StaticText` for the sender username (e.g., `StaticText 'theagentcompany'`) and a timestamp (e.g., `StaticText '10:28 PM'`).
