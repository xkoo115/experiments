# ACTION #
During task execution, you can perform **Actions**, including:
1. **Tool Call**
2. **Python Code Execution**

## Action Output Format
1. **Tool Call**
When calling a tool, please output:
<tool_call>
{"name": "<function-name>", "arguments": <args-json-object>}
</tool_call>
- `<function-name>`: Tool function name
- `<args-json-object>`: Call arguments (JSON format)
- If multiple `<tool_call>` are output at once, only the first one will be executed; the rest will be ignored.

Available tool signatures are provided within the `<tools>` tag:
<tools>
{"type": "function", "function": {"name": "extract_image_content_by_gpt4o", "description": "Utilizes `gpt-4o` to interpret and extract content from local image files (e.g., PNG, JPEG). Highly effective for **scanned documents, image-based PDFs (post-conversion to image formats),** or visual data. For optimal extraction, craft precise queries. **Caution: While effective for general content, direct numerical or highly structured extraction from complex visual elements (e.g., tally marks, handwritten notes) may be imprecise; robust post-processing is often required. For multi-page documents, convert each page into a separate image and ensure *all* generated image pages are processed for complete data extraction.**", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"image_path": {"type": "string", "description": "Local image path."}, "query": {"type": "string", "description": "Query to the gpt-4o to get the image content."}}, "required": ["image_path", "query"]}}}

Element indices are dynamic and highly volatile; always verify the target element's existence and index using `browser_wait_and_get_update` immediately before clicking. Be aware that even with immediate updates, indices can shift in very dynamic UIs. Crucially, after clicking, always use `browser_wait_and_get_update` to immediately re-evaluate the page state and confirm the intended effect (e.g., UI changes, navigation). For navigation, `browser_go_to_url` is a more robust alternative when a direct URL is known. For form submissions or general action triggers, `browser_send_keys` with 'Enter' is often a more robust alternative, especially when direct clicking by index proves unreliable. Avoid clicking elements that are not currently visible or interactable.", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"index": {"type": "integer", "description": "The index number of the target element."}}, "required": ["index"]}}}

Highly effective for extracting natural language text from dynamic UIs (e.g., chat messages, complex reports) where direct `accessibility tree` parsing proves unreliable or insufficient. **Important Limitation:** This tool can only extract content that is *visually present* on the current screen (within the browser's viewport). It cannot process content that is scrolled out of view or exists on other pages of a paginated list. While `accessibility tree` and `interactive elements` are primary for UI understanding, this visual tool can be a highly effective *primary* method for text extraction in challenging scenarios. **Crucially, for critical or structured data (e.g., IDs, specific names, numerical values), always cross-verify with or prefer extraction from the `webpage accessibility tree` as visual interpretation may introduce inaccuracies, especially for abbreviated or visually ambiguous elements.**", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"query": {"type": "string", "description": "Query to the VL model to get the browser page content."}}, "required": ["query"]}}}

If the provided `index` does not correspond to a scrollable container, the tool will default to scrolling the entire page. Useful for navigating content that extends beyond the current viewport. **Note: For comprehensively extracting data from dynamically loading lists (e.g., project lists, search results), repeated scrolling combined with UI element extraction can be unreliable. Prefer API-based data retrieval when available for such tasks.**", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"down": {"type": "boolean", "description": "True to scroll down, False to scroll up", "default": true}, "num_pages": {"type": "number", "description": "Number of pages to scroll (0.5 = half page, 1.0 = one page, etc.)", "default": 0.5}, "index": {"type": "integer", "description": "Optional element index to find scroll container for", "default": null}}, "required": []}}}

{"type": "function", "function": {"name": "browser_wait_and_get_update", "description": "Wait for a set amount of time, then retrieve the latest browser accessibility tree and interactive elements. This tool is indispensable for dynamic UIs, allowing the agent to detect UI changes, wait for content to load (e.g., chat messages, dynamic forms), confirm the effects of previous actions, or **to refresh the page state and acquire current element indices before attempting new interactions**. The `webpage interactive elements` from its output are highly dynamic and should be used immediately. For verifying responses or dynamic updates, consider setting `seconds` to a value appropriate for expected latency (e.g., `seconds=1` for immediate state, longer for human-like response times). **This tool is a fundamental prerequisite for almost all subsequent browser interactions due to the highly dynamic nature of web UI element indices.**", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"seconds": {"type": "integer", "description": "The number of seconds to wait, the default is 3 seconds.", "default": 3}}, "required": []}}}

Returns a JSON object with `execution_status`, `returncode`, `stdout`, and `stderr`. **Important Precautions**: 1) `returncode=0` does not guarantee successful side effects (e.g., file creation); always verify with independent checks (`ls -l`, `file`). 2) **This tool executes commands in a *minimal* shell environment. Complex shell features like command chaining (`&&`, `||`), pipes (`|`), I/O redirection (`>`, `>>`), and backgrounding (`&`) are often *not reliably interpreted by `run_cmd` directly* and can lead to unexpected behavior or errors (e.g., `SyntaxError`, `command not found`). For any non-trivial shell interaction or complex logic, *always prefer consolidating operations into a single Python script that uses `subprocess` for explicit control and robustness* over multiple `run_cmd` calls or complex shell syntax.** 3) Quote arguments containing spaces (`\"path with spaces\"`). 4) State changes (`cd`) do not persist across calls.", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"command": {"type": "string", "description": "command暂时没有参数描述"}}, "required": ["command"]}}}
</tools>

2. **Python Code Execution**
When executing Python code, please output:
<code>
... your code ...
</code>
- The working directory is `/workspace`
- Executing dangerous, destructive, or time-consuming code is prohibited.
- If both a **Tool Call** and **Python Code Execution** are included in the output, the tool call takes precedence, and the Python code will not be executed.
- Using outdated or limited python libraries may result in incomplete or inaccurate observations (e.g. missing images from PDFs or failing to extract key content). Always prefer robust, modern libraries to ensure full and reliable results.
- When performing file conversion or data extraction, always ensure **data integrity**. Verify that the structure, content, and critical fields of the source file are preserved in the output. Check row and column counts, headers, and key values before and after processing. **Avoid silent loss**, truncation, or unintended alteration of data.

## Action Execution Result Processing
- After each action is executed, an Observation is returned, which includes:
    1. `<tool_response>`: The result of the tool or code execution.
    2. `<tool_instruction>`: The instruction associated with a specific action, used to guide the next step or restrict subsequent behavior.
- **Note**: Do not fabricate observations.

## Security and Restrictions
- **Coding Actions (such as Python, CMD, etc.)**
    - Do not run high-risk operations that are large in code size or take a long time.
    - Do not execute code that could cause data loss, system damage, or irreversible changes.
    - Do not use the kill command with wildcards like * or other dangerous parameters that could result in a wide range of matches.
    - Prefer using the Python interpreter to execute code (safer and more efficient) rather than using the CMD tool.

> ⚠️ **Important**
> When your output contains content that fully conforms to the **Tool Call** or **Python Code Execution** format, the system will immediately parse, identify, and execute it as an **Action** without further confirmation and without reversal.
> Therefore, before outputting, always confirm that this is your **intended** action and fully assess the potential consequences and risks.
> If you are only using **quotes, demonstrations, or examples**, be sure to break the formatting or escape it to prevent the system from interpreting it as a real action.

# OBJECTIVE #
Your core objective is to independently and efficiently complete the tasks assigned to you by the company.


# MEMORY #
During previous tasks, you have accumulated the following reusable knowledge:

## Resolution Patterns
Comprehensive Contextualization: Systematically acquire and aggregate information from diverse, potentially unstructured sources, prioritizing local processing and cross-validation, to ensure a complete, coherent operational view and inform robust decisions.
Robust External Interaction: Prioritize stable, predictable interaction methods, such as structured APIs, and dynamically adapt strategies to ensure continuity and reliability with external systems despite their inconsistencies or volatility.
Adaptive Constraint Handling: When an objective is blocked by an unresolvable external constraint, acknowledge the limitation, perform necessary cleanup of partial artifacts, and adapt the strategy to proceed with viable data, avoiding unproductive retries.
Modular Resilient Design: Decompose operations into modular, decoupled units with explicit state management, to enhance predictability, isolate errors, improve maintainability, and ensure operational continuity.
Progressive Verification: Implement multi-stage validation, from granular checks within pipelines to comprehensive outcome validation, to localize errors, confirm system states, and ensure successful execution.

## Platform/Application Operation Guides
These guides summarize proven operation paths derived from past successful experiences.  
Each item is a structured reference designed to help you complete operations more quickly, accurately, and with reduced redundancy.

> This directory provides a comprehensive index of guides, compiling best practices and experience summaries for accomplishing various tasks.

### Recommended Usage Process
1. **Review the Guide First**  
   Before starting a task, browse the relevant entries in the directory to identify potentially useful guidance.  
2. **Targeted Access**  
   Use the `access_the_application_guide` tool to view detailed steps if necessary.  
3. **Reuse with Flexibility**  
   Apply past successful steps when they fit the current situation, but stay aware of possible mismatches.  
4. **Explore When Deviations Arise**  
   If the environment or results diverge from the guide, stop rigidly following it and explore alternative approaches through small, safe, and adaptive steps.

### Value of Guides
- Reduce task completion time by leveraging accumulated experience.  
- Lower error rates and avoid common pitfalls.  
- Ensure consistent, professional execution of tasks.  

### Guide Reliability & Adaptation
- Guides may be outdated, biased, or contain errors — they are “historical experience,” not absolute truth.  
- Use guides as starting points, not as strict rules.  
- When deviations or conflicts appear, **exit the guide and explore new paths** instead of persisting.  
- Record useful deviation points for later improvement of the guides.

### Subtask Completion Report

**Title**: Verification of Subtask 1: Login to OwnCloud and Navigate to Resumes Folder

**Checklist Details**:

*   **Check 1: Login Status Verification**
    *   **Goal**: Verify that the agent has successfully logged into OwnCloud by checking for elements indicative of the file management interface (e.g., 'Files link', 'User menu') and the absence of login-related elements on the current page.
    *   **Result**: **PASSED**. The Task Agent's `browser_wait_and_get_update` after the login attempt (Action 7) showed elements like "Files link" (element 2) and "User menu" (element 7), and critically, no login fields. This confirms successful authentication and navigation to the OwnCloud file management interface.

*   **Check 2: Current Directory Verification**
    *   **Goal**: Confirm that the browser is currently displaying the contents of the 'resumes' folder within OwnCloud.
    *   **Result**: **PASSED**. The `tool_response` from `browser_wait_and_get_update` after navigating to the 'resumes' folder (Action 14) explicitly listed "27. resumes.zip file" as an interactive element. The presence of the target file directly confirms that the agent is in the correct directory.

*   **Check 3: 'resumes.zip' Presence Verification**
    *   **Goal**: Verify the presence of the 'resumes.zip' file within the currently displayed 'resumes' folder in OwnCloud.
    *   **Result**: **PASSED**. As noted in Check 2, the `tool_response` from Action 14 explicitly included "27. resumes.zip file" in its list of interactive elements, confirming its presence.

**Conclusion**:
The Task Agent has successfully completed Subtask 1: "Login to OwnCloud and Navigate to Resumes Folder". All verification checks confirmed that the agent successfully logged into OwnCloud, navigated to the correct 'resumes' folder, and confirmed the presence of the `resumes.zip` file within that folder.

If an `Element index does not exist` error is returned, it indicates extreme element volatility. **Always re-evaluate `webpage interactive elements` with `browser_wait_and_get_update` immediately before attempting a click, and crucially, confirm the element's `text` or `aria-label` attribute semantically matches the intended target.** If direct clicking by index proves unreliable, *especially within dynamic lists or sidebars (e.g., chat contact lists)*, consider alternative strategies like using an application's built-in search functionality or `browser_go_to_url` if a direct link is known, rather than repeatedly retrying. For form submissions or general action triggers, `browser_send_keys` with 'Enter' is a more robust alternative and **highly recommended for reliability**.

### Subtask Completion Report

**Title**: Verification of Subtask 2: Download resumes.zip

**Checklist Details**:

*   **Check 1: File Existence Verification**
    *   **Goal**: Confirm that the 'resumes.zip' file exists in the current working directory (/workspace).
    *   **Result**: **PASSED**. The `ls -l resumes.zip` command (executed by me in the first Check Step) returned `returncode: 0` and its `stdout` (Observation from the first Check Step) explicitly showed "-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 195670 Dec 10  2024 resumes.zip", confirming the file's presence in the `/workspace` directory.

*   **Check 2: File Size Verification**
    *   **Goal**: Confirm that the downloaded 'resumes.zip' file's size matches the size reported in the `wget` output (195670 bytes).
    *   **Result**: **PASSED**. The `ls -l resumes.zip` command output (from my first Check Step) showed the file size as `195670` bytes. This precisely matches the `Length: 195670 (191K)` and `[195670/195670]` reported in the Task Agent's `wget` command's `stderr` (USER MESSAGE, Action 15).

**Conclusion**:
The Task Agent has successfully completed Subtask 2: "Download resumes.zip". Both verification checks confirmed the existence of the `resumes.zip` file in the `/workspace` directory and that its size matches the expected downloaded size.

Thought: The `unzip` command executed successfully with a return code of 0, and the `stdout` clearly indicates that numerous PDF files (and some `__MACOSX` files, which are common on macOS and can be ignored for content extraction) have been inflated into the `resumes_extracted` directory. This confirms that all individual resume files have been successfully extracted from `resumes.zip` into the designated directory.
Final Answer: All individual resume files are successfully extracted from 'resumes.zip' into a designated directory.

### Subtask Completion Report

**Title**: Verification of Subtask 3: Extract Resumes

**Checklist Details**:

*   **Check 1: Directory Creation Verification**
    *   **Goal**: Confirm that the 'resumes_extracted' directory was successfully created in the current working directory.
    *   **Result**: **PASSED**. My `run_cmd` execution of `ls -d resumes_extracted` returned `returncode: 0` and `stdout: "resumes_extracted"`, explicitly confirming the directory's existence. This aligns with the Task Agent's `mkdir` command (Action 6), which also reported `returncode: 0` (Observation 7).

*   **Check 2: File Extraction Verification**
    *   **Goal**: Confirm that PDF files were successfully extracted into the 'resumes_extracted' directory.
    *   **Result**: **PASSED**. The `stdout` from the Task Agent's `unzip` command (Observation 9) clearly showed numerous PDF files, such as "Aaliyah_Thompson.pdf" and "Aarav_Patel.pdf", being "inflated" into the `resumes_extracted` directory. The `unzip` command also reported a `returncode: 0`, indicating successful operation.

**Conclusion**:
The Task Agent has successfully completed Subtask 3: "Extract Resumes". Both verification checks confirmed that the `resumes_extracted` directory was created and that the individual resume files were successfully extracted into it.

<task>
Our company wants to hire a new software engineer who can help us build our agent
infrastructure. You need to screen a large number of resumes and find candidates
that are good fits for this position. LLM knowledge is not required but helpful.
Experience with OpenHands is a must. There's no other requirement on degree or
years of experience.

You can find all resumes on owncloud (http://the-agent-company.com:8092/). Navigate to
Documents - Human Resources Team - resumes, and you will see a resumes.zip file.

Finally, goto RocketChat (http://the-agent-company.com:3000/) and tell
Chen Xinyi if you find any qualified candidates. If you do, tell her the candidates'
names.

Thought: The `ls -R resumes_extracted` command successfully listed the contents of the directory. It confirms that the PDF files are indeed directly within `resumes_extracted`, along with a `__MACOSX` directory. The previous `ls resumes_extracted/*.pdf` failed likely due to how `run_cmd` handles shell wildcards or the specific shell environment it uses.

Now that I know the structure, I can proceed with extracting text from each PDF. The `ExtractTextFromPDF` guide suggests using `PyPDF2`. First, I need to ensure `PyPDF2` is installed. I will use `pip show PyPDF2` to check if it's installed. If not, I will install it.

### Subtask Completion Report

**Title**: Verification of Subtask 4: Extract Text Content from Resumes

**Checklist Details**:

*   **Check 1: ExtractedDirectoryExistence**
    *   **Goal**: Verify that the `extracted_texts` directory was successfully created.
    *   **Result**: **PASSED**. The Task Agent's `mkdir extracted_texts` command (USER MESSAGE, Action 12) returned `"returncode": 0` (Observation 13), confirming the directory's creation.

*   **Check 2: ExtractedFileCount**
    *   **Goal**: Verify that the number of `.txt` files created in the `extracted_texts` directory matches the reported count of 94.
    *   **Result**: **PASSED**. My Python script (executed in the second Check Step) confirmed that there are 94 `.txt` files in the `extracted_texts` directory. This matches the Task Agent's reported successful extraction of "94 resumes" (USER MESSAGE, Observation 15).

*   **Check 3: SampleFileContentIntegrity**
    *   **Goal**: Verify that a sample extracted text file (e.g., `extracted_texts/Tan_Rui.txt`) contains actual, non-empty text content, indicating successful text extraction.
    *   **Result**: **PASSED**. The `cat extracted_texts/Tan_Rui.txt` command (executed by me in the third Check Step) returned a `stdout` containing substantial, meaningful text content (Observation from the third Check Step), confirming successful text extraction into the file.

**Conclusion**:
The Task Agent has successfully completed Subtask 4: "Extract Text Content from Resumes". All verification checks confirmed that the `extracted_texts` directory was created, the correct number of text files were generated, and a sample file contained valid extracted content.

The current subtask has been successfully completed, and substantial new information has been obtained.  
Carefully review the updated context and determine how this new knowledge impacts the overall task progress.  
Design the next subtask to effectively leverage these insights and move closer to completing the full task.

Always remember that your ultimate goal is to complete task:
<task>
Our company wants to hire a new software engineer who can help us build our agent
infrastructure. You need to screen a large number of resumes and find candidates
that are good fits for this position. LLM knowledge is not required but helpful.
Experience with OpenHands is a must. There's no other requirement on degree or
years of experience.

You can find all resumes on owncloud (http://the-agent-company.com:8092/). Navigate to
Documents - Human Resources Team - resumes, and you will see a resumes.zip file.

Finally, goto RocketChat (http://the-agent-company.com:3000/) and tell
Chen Xinyi if you find any qualified candidates. If you do, tell her the candidates'
names.
</task>
65. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================
* The information you know and have obtained is:
    1. The task is to screen resumes for a Software Engineer position.
    2. The primary requirement for the position is "Experience with OpenHands is a must".
    3. LLM knowledge is helpful but not required.
    4. There are no other requirements for degree or years of experience.
    5. Resumes are located on OwnCloud (http://the-agent-company.com:8092/) under `Documents/Human Resources Team/resumes/resumes.zip`.
    6. I need to report qualified candidates' names to Chen Xinyi on RocketChat (http://the-agent-company.com:3000/).
    7. I have successfully logged into OwnCloud.
    8. I have successfully navigated to the `Documents/Human Resources Team/resumes/` folder on OwnCloud.
    9. I have verified the presence of the `resumes.zip` file within the `resumes` folder.
    10. I have successfully downloaded the `resumes.zip` file to the local workspace.
    11. I have successfully extracted all individual resume files (PDFs) from `resumes.zip` into the `resumes_extracted` directory.
    12. I have successfully extracted text content from all PDF resumes and saved them as `.txt` files in the `extracted_texts` directory.

* The task can be divided into the following subtasks:
    1. Screen Resumes for 'OpenHands' Experience: A list of candidate names is generated, identifying those whose resumes contain the keyword 'OpenHands'.
    2. Login to RocketChat: Successfully logged into RocketChat.
    3. Notify Chen Xinyi of Qualified Candidates: A message is successfully sent to Chen Xinyi on RocketChat, listing the names of qualified candidates or stating that none were found.

69. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================
Thought: I have accessed the `SearchTextFileForKeywords` guide. It provides a Python code snippet using `re` to search for keywords in a text file. My plan is to:
1. Get a list of all extracted text files (the `.txt` files in `extracted_texts`).
2. Iterate through each text file.
3. For each file, search for the keyword "OpenHands" (case-insensitive).
4. If "OpenHands" is found, extract the candidate's name from the filename and add it to a list of qualified candidates.
5. After checking all files, the list of qualified candidates will be the result of this subtask.

I will use Python code to achieve this.

### Subtask Completion Report

**Title**: Verification of Subtask 5: Screen Resumes for 'OpenHands' Experience

**Checklist Details**:

*   **Check 1: Verification of Alex Chen's Resume Content**
    *   **Goal**: Confirm that the file 'extracted_texts/Alex_Chen.txt' contains the keyword 'OpenHands' (case-insensitive).
    *   **Result**: **PASSED**. My Python script re-validated the content of `extracted_texts/Alex_Chen.txt` and confirmed the presence of the 'OpenHands' keyword, as indicated by the `stdout: "Keyword 'OpenHands' found in 'extracted_texts/Alex_Chen.txt': True"` from my executed code. This confirms the accuracy of the Task Agent's initial finding for this specific candidate.

*   **Check 2: Verification of Comprehensive Candidate List**
    *   **Goal**: Re-execute the resume screening logic for the keyword 'OpenHands' across all extracted text files and compare the resulting list of qualified candidates with the one generated by the Task Agent.
    *   **Result**: **PASSED**. I re-ran the resume screening logic across all extracted text files using the same criteria as the Task Agent. My execution produced the list `['Alex Chen']` as the only qualified candidate, which precisely matched the `stdout: "Qualified candidates: ['Alex Chen']"` reported by the Task Agent. This confirms that the Task Agent's identified list is both correct and comprehensive based on the specified keyword search.

**Conclusion**:
The Task Agent has successfully completed Subtask 5: "Screen Resumes for 'OpenHands' Experience". All verification checks confirmed that the Task Agent correctly identified the qualified candidate(s) by screening the extracted resumes for the 'OpenHands' keyword.

### Subtask Completion Report

**Title**: Verification of Subtask 6: Login to RocketChat

**Checklist Details**:

*   **Check 1: Login Form Disappearance Verification**
    *   **Goal**: Verify that the login form elements (username input, password input, and login button) are no longer present on the page after the Task Agent's login attempt.
    *   **Result**: **PASSED**. The `webpage interactive elements` after the login attempt (Observation 11) no longer contained the login form fields (`input` with placeholders "Email or username" and "Password", and the "Login" button), indicating successful navigation away from the login screen.

*   **Check 2: Dashboard Elements Presence Verification**
    *   **Goal**: Verify the presence of key RocketChat dashboard elements (e.g., 'Home', 'Search' buttons, channel lists, and specifically 'chen_xinyi' direct message link) on the page.
    *   **Result**: **PASSED**. The `webpage accessibility tree` and `webpage interactive elements` in Observation 11 showed the presence of expected dashboard elements like "Home" and "Search" buttons, as well as channel links ("general", "kudos") and the "chen_xinyi" direct message link. This confirms the successful landing on the RocketChat dashboard.

**Conclusion**:
The Task Agent has successfully completed Subtask 6: "Login to RocketChat". All verification checks confirmed that the agent successfully logged into RocketChat.

### Subtask Completion Report

**Title**: Verification of Subtask 7: Notify Chen Xinyi of Qualified Candidates

**Checklist Details**:

*   **Check 1: ChatNavigationVerification**
    *   **Goal**: Verify that the browser is currently on Chen Xinyi's direct message page by checking the URL and the heading in the webpage accessibility tree.
    *   **Result**: **PASSED**. After the agent clicked on the 'chen_xinyi' link (USER MESSAGE 06), the `webpage accessibility tree` in the subsequent observation (USER MESSAGE 07) displayed a URL of `http://the-agent-company.com:3000/direct/CZYWHd5bCmhj5YcFec2uqaen3naCexvzDE` and a heading `chen_xinyi`, confirming successful navigation to the direct message conversation.

*   **Check 2: MessageInputVerification**
    *   **Goal**: Verify that the correct message text ('Hi Chen Xinyi, I found a qualified candidate for the Software Engineer position: Alex Chen.') was successfully input into the message field before sending, by inspecting the webpage accessibility tree after the input action.
    *   **Result**: **PASSED**. The `webpage accessibility tree` after the `browser_input_text` action (USER MESSAGE 09) clearly showed the exact message "Hi Chen Xinyi, I found a qualified candidate for the Software Engineer position: Alex Chen." within the `textbox` element, confirming accurate input.

*   **Check 3: MessageDeliveryConfirmation**
    *   **Goal**: Confirm that the message sent by the Task Agent is visibly present in the chat history on the page, indicated by a paragraph element containing the exact message content associated with the sender ('theagentcompany') in the webpage accessibility tree after sending the message.
    *   **Result**: **PASSED**. After the `browser_send_keys` action (USER MESSAGE 10), the `webpage accessibility tree` (USER MESSAGE 11) contained a `paragraph` element with the message "Hi Chen Xinyi, I found a qualified candidate for the Software Engineer position: Alex Chen.", immediately preceded by `StaticText 'theagentcompany'` and a timestamp, consistent with the `SendMessage` guide's verification instructions (USER MESSAGE 03).

*   **Check 4: MessageInputFieldClearedVerification**
    *   **Goal**: Verify that the message input field is cleared after the message has been sent, indicating successful submission, by checking if the input field's content is empty or its placeholder is visible again in the webpage interactive elements or accessibility tree.
    *   **Result**: **PASSED**. The `webpage interactive elements` in USER MESSAGE 11, following the message submission, showed the `textarea` (index 66) with `placeholder="Message"` and no active text content, indicating that the input field was successfully cleared as expected.

**Conclusion**:\
The Task Agent has successfully completed Subtask 7: "Notify Chen Xinyi of Qualified Candidates". All verification checks confirmed that the agent navigated to the correct chat, input the correct message, and successfully sent it, resulting in the message appearing in the chat history and the input field being cleared.

Our company wants to hire a new software engineer who can help us build our agent

years of experience.

You can find all resumes on owncloud (http://the-agent-company.com:8092/). Navigate to
Documents - Human Resources Team - resumes, and you will see a resumes.zip file.

Finally, goto RocketChat (http://the-agent-company.com:3000/) and tell
Chen Xinyi if you find any qualified candidates. If you do, tell her the candidates'
