Returns a JSON object with `execution_status`, `returncode`, `stdout`, and `stderr`. **Important Precautions**: 1) `returncode=0` does not guarantee successful side effects (e.g., file creation); always verify with independent checks (`ls -l`, `file`). 2) **This tool executes commands in a *minimal* shell environment. Complex shell features like command chaining (`&&`, `||`), pipes (`|`), I/O redirection (`>`, `>>`), and backgrounding (`&`) are often *not reliably interpreted by `run_cmd` directly* and can lead to unexpected behavior or errors (e.g., `SyntaxError`, `command not found`). For any non-trivial shell interaction or complex logic, *always prefer consolidating operations into a single Python script that uses `subprocess` for explicit control and robustness* over multiple `run_cmd` calls or complex shell syntax.** 3) Quote arguments containing spaces (`\"path with spaces\"`). 4) State changes (`cd`) do not persist across calls.", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"command": {"type": "string", "description": "command暂时没有参数描述"}}, "required": ["command"]}}}
</tools>

2. **Python Code Execution**
When executing Python code, please output:
<code>
... your code ...
</code>
- The working directory is `/workspace`
- Executing dangerous, destructive, or time-consuming code is prohibited.
- If both a **Tool Call** and **Python Code Execution** are included in the output, the tool call takes precedence, and the Python code will not be executed.
- Using outdated or limited python libraries may result in incomplete or inaccurate observations (e.g. missing images from PDFs or failing to extract key content). Always prefer robust, modern libraries to ensure full and reliable results.
- When performing file conversion or data extraction, always ensure **data integrity**. Verify that the structure, content, and critical fields of the source file are preserved in the output. Check row and column counts, headers, and key values before and after processing. **Avoid silent loss**, truncation, or unintended alteration of data.

## Action Execution Result Processing
- After each action is executed, an Observation is returned, which includes:
    1. `<tool_response>`: The result of the tool or code execution.
    2. `<tool_instruction>`: The instruction associated with a specific action, used to guide the next step or restrict subsequent behavior.
- **Note**: Do not fabricate observations.

## Security and Restrictions
- **Coding Actions (such as Python, CMD, etc.)**
    - Do not run high-risk operations that are large in code size or take a long time.
    - Do not execute code that could cause data loss, system damage, or irreversible changes.
    - Do not use the kill command with wildcards like * or other dangerous parameters that could result in a wide range of matches.
    - Prefer using the Python interpreter to execute code (safer and more efficient) rather than using the CMD tool.

> ⚠️ **Important**
> When your output contains content that fully conforms to the **Tool Call** or **Python Code Execution** format, the system will immediately parse, identify, and execute it as an **Action** without further confirmation and without reversal.
> Therefore, before outputting, always confirm that this is your **intended** action and fully assess the potential consequences and risks.
> If you are only using **quotes, demonstrations, or examples**, be sure to break the formatting or escape it to prevent the system from interpreting it as a real action.

# OBJECTIVE #
Your core objective is to independently and efficiently complete the tasks assigned to you by the company.


# MEMORY #
During previous tasks, you have accumulated the following reusable knowledge:

## Resolution Patterns
Comprehensive Contextualization: Systematically acquire and aggregate information from diverse, potentially unstructured sources, prioritizing local processing and cross-validation, to ensure a complete, coherent operational view and inform robust decisions.
Robust External Interaction: Prioritize stable, predictable interaction methods, such as structured APIs, and dynamically adapt strategies to ensure continuity and reliability with external systems despite their inconsistencies or volatility.
Adaptive Constraint Handling: When an objective is blocked by an unresolvable external constraint, acknowledge the limitation, perform necessary cleanup of partial artifacts, and adapt the strategy to proceed with viable data, avoiding unproductive retries.
Modular Resilient Design: Decompose operations into modular, decoupled units with explicit state management, to enhance predictability, isolate errors, improve maintainability, and ensure operational continuity.
Progressive Verification: Implement multi-stage validation, from granular checks within pipelines to comprehensive outcome validation, to localize errors, confirm system states, and ensure successful execution.

## Platform/Application Operation Guides
These guides summarize proven operation paths derived from past successful experiences.  
Each item is a structured reference designed to help you complete operations more quickly, accurately, and with reduced redundancy.

> This directory provides a comprehensive index of guides, compiling best practices and experience summaries for accomplishing various tasks.

### Recommended Usage Process
1. **Review the Guide First**  
   Before starting a task, browse the relevant entries in the directory to identify potentially useful guidance.  
2. **Targeted Access**  
   Use the `access_the_application_guide` tool to view detailed steps if necessary.  
3. **Reuse with Flexibility**  
   Apply past successful steps when they fit the current situation, but stay aware of possible mismatches.  
4. **Explore When Deviations Arise**  
   If the environment or results diverge from the guide, stop rigidly following it and explore alternative approaches through small, safe, and adaptive steps.

### Value of Guides
- Reduce task completion time by leveraging accumulated experience.  
- Lower error rates and avoid common pitfalls.  
- Ensure consistent, professional execution of tasks.  

### Guide Reliability & Adaptation
- Guides may be outdated, biased, or contain errors — they are “historical experience,” not absolute truth.  
- Use guides as starting points, not as strict rules.  
- When deviations or conflicts appear, **exit the guide and explore new paths** instead of persisting.  
- Record useful deviation points for later improvement of the guides.

</tool_response>
<tool_instruction>
After accessing, carefully read the guide content. Extract and adapt relevant steps, recognizing that guide information may be outdated or require UI verification. Always prioritize current browser state by performing `browser_wait_and_get_update()` immediately before attempting to follow guide steps.
</tool_instruction>

07. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================
Thought: I have accessed the Plane login guide. The guide outlines the steps to log in, including navigating to the URL, entering email and password, and clicking buttons. I will start by navigating to the Plane URL and then use `browser_wait_and_get_update` to get the interactive elements.
Action:
<tool_call>
{"name": "browser_go_to_url", "arguments": {"url": "http://the-agent-company.com:8091/"}}
</tool_call>
08. | ================================================== USER MESSAGE ==================================================
Observation: 
<tool_response>
Performed browser action: 🔗 Navigated to http://the-agent-company.com:8091/
The updated browser page status is as follows:
<webpage accessibility tree>[SYSTEM INFO: History accessibility tree removed for brevity]</webpage accessibility tree>
<webpage interactive elements>[SYSTEM INFO: History interactive elements removed for brevity]</webpage interactive elements>

</tool_response>
<tool_instruction>
Always inspect the `webpage accessibility tree` and `webpage interactive elements` after navigation to confirm the page loaded as expected. This step is crucial for verifying successful navigation and for preparing for subsequent interactions by ensuring the browser state is as anticipated.
</tool_instruction>

09. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================
Thought: The browser has successfully navigated to the Plane login page. I need to input the email address "agent@company.com" into the email field (index 3).
Action:
<tool_call>
{"name": "browser_input_text", "arguments": {"index": 3, "text": "agent@company.com"}}
</tool_call>
10. | ================================================== USER MESSAGE ==================================================
Observation: 
<tool_response>
Performed browser action: ⌨️  Input agent@company.com into index 3
The updated browser page status is as follows:
<webpage accessibility tree>[SYSTEM INFO: History accessibility tree removed for brevity]</webpage accessibility tree>
<webpage interactive elements>[SYSTEM INFO: History interactive elements removed for brevity]</webpage interactive elements>

</tool_response>
<tool_instruction>
After inputting text, always use `browser_wait_and_get_update` to verify the text input, check for immediate validation feedback, or confirm any UI changes (e.g., enable/disable buttons, form submission readiness). Be especially mindful of index volatility, as UI changes can rapidly invalidate previously retrieved indices.
</tool_instruction>

11. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================
Thought: I have successfully entered the email address. Now I need to click the "Continue" button. Based on the interactive elements, the "Continue" button has index 4.
Action:
<tool_call>
{"name": "browser_click", "arguments": {"index": 4}}
</tool_call>
12. | ================================================== USER MESSAGE ==================================================
Observation: 
<tool_response>
Performed browser action: Clicked button with index 4: Continue
The updated browser page status is as follows:
<webpage accessibility tree>[SYSTEM INFO: History accessibility tree removed for brevity]</webpage accessibility tree>
<webpage interactive elements>[SYSTEM INFO: History interactive elements removed for brevity]</webpage interactive elements>

</tool_response>
<tool_instruction>
If an `Element index does not exist` error is returned, it indicates extreme element volatility. **Always re-evaluate `webpage interactive elements` with `browser_wait_and_get_update` immediately before attempting a click, and crucially, confirm the element's `text` or `aria-label` attribute semantically matches the intended target.** If direct clicking by index proves unreliable, *especially within dynamic lists or sidebars (e.g., chat contact lists)*, consider alternative strategies like using an application's built-in search functionality or `browser_go_to_url` if a direct link is known, rather than repeatedly retrying. For form submissions or general action triggers, `browser_send_keys` with 'Enter' is a more robust alternative and **highly recommended for reliability**.
</tool_instruction>

13. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================
Thought: The email has been entered, and the page has updated to show the password input field. I need to input the password "theagentcompany" into the password field, which is now at index 4.

If an `Element index does not exist` error is returned, it indicates extreme element volatility. **Always re-evaluate `webpage interactive elements` with `browser_wait_and_get_update` immediately before attempting a click, and crucially, confirm the element's `text` or `aria-label` attribute semantically matches the intended target.** If direct clicking by index proves unreliable, *especially within dynamic lists or sidebars (e.g., chat contact lists)*, consider alternative strategies like using an application's built-in search functionality or `browser_go_to_url` if a direct link is known, rather than repeatedly retrying. For form submissions or general action triggers, `browser_send_keys` with 'Enter' is a more robust alternative and **highly recommended for reliability**.

    - **Expected Outcome:** The issue details (ID, Title, Status) extracted by the Task Agent should accurately reflect the information in the accessibility tree for 'In Progress' issues.
    - **Actual Outcome:** The extracted issue `{'Issue ID': 'JANUS-3', 'Issue Title': 'Research and design new algorithms', 'Status': 'In Progress'}` precisely matches the details of the 'In Progress' issue found within the `webpage accessibility tree` in step 07.
- **Check 2: Verify Completeness of 'In Progress' Issue Extraction**
    - **Verification Method:** Conducted a comprehensive manual review of the `webpage accessibility tree` in USER MESSAGE (step 07) to identify all 'In Progress' issues present on the page.
    - **Expected Outcome:** All 'In Progress' issues identified in the accessibility tree should be present in the output from `browser_extract_content_by_vision`.
    - **Actual Outcome:** Only one 'In Progress' issue (`JANUS-3 - Research and design new algorithms`) was found in the `webpage accessibility tree`. This single issue was correctly identified and extracted by the Task Agent. No 'In Progress' issues were missed.
- **Check 3: Verify Final Output Structure**
    - **Verification Method:** Examined the format of the `Final Answer` provided by the Task Agent in step 08.
    - **Expected Outcome:** The output should be a structured list of issues, with each issue being a dictionary containing 'Issue ID', 'Issue Title', and 'Status' fields.
    - **Actual Outcome:** The `Final Answer` `[{'Issue ID': 'JANUS-3', 'Issue Title': 'Research and design new algorithms', 'Status': 'In Progress'}]` is indeed a list containing a dictionary, and this dictionary correctly includes all the required fields ('Issue ID', 'Issue Title', 'Status').

Checklist Details:
- **Check 1: Verify successful issue creation and navigation.**
    - **Verification Method:** Examined the `url` and `title` within the `RootWebArea` in USER MESSAGE (step 17).
    - **Expected Outcome:** The URL should match `http://the-agent-company.com:8929/root/janusgraph/-/issues/<issue_id>` and the page title should include the new issue's title and "Issues · Administrator / janusgraph · GitLab".
    - **Actual Outcome:** The `RootWebArea` in USER MESSAGE (step 17) showed `url='http://the-agent-company.com:8929/root/janusgraph/-/issues/4659'` and `title='Research and design new algorithms (#4659) · Issues · Administrator / janusgraph · GitLab'`. This confirms successful creation and navigation to the new issue page.

- **Check 2: Verify the title of the created issue.**
    - **Verification Method:** Checked the `heading` element and the `RootWebArea` title in the `webpage accessibility tree` in USER MESSAGE (step 17).
    - **Expected Outcome:** The issue title displayed on the GitLab page should be "Research and design new algorithms".
    - **Actual Outcome:** The `heading` element clearly stated `'Research and design new algorithms'`, and the `RootWebArea` title also contained `'Research and design new algorithms'`. This matches the expected title from the Plane issue.

- **Check 3: Verify the description of the created issue.**
    - **Verification Method:** Inspected the `paragraph` element within the `webpage accessibility tree` in USER MESSAGE (step 17), which represents the issue description.
    - **Expected Outcome:** The issue description should be "Issue ID: JANUS-3, Issue Title: Research and design new algorithms".

Thought: The browser is currently on the GitLab issues page for the janusgraph project, which is the correct location to verify the newly created issue. I have identified the issue "Research and design new algorithms" within the `webpage accessibility tree`. The issue's title and its presence in the list confirm that it was successfully transferred from Plane to GitLab. Since the task was to add all "In Progress" tasks, and only one such task was identified and successfully transferred, this subtask is complete.
Final Answer: The issue "Research and design new algorithms" (JANUS-3) has been successfully verified as present in the GitLab 'janusgraph' project issues list.

Title: Subtask Completion Report - Verify Issues in GitLab

Checklist Details:
- **Check 1: Verify successful navigation to the specified GitLab issues page.**
    - **Verification Method:** Reviewed the `RootWebArea` from the Task Agent's observation in step 05.
    - **Expected Outcome:** The URL should be `http://the-agent-company.com:8929/root/janusgraph/-/issues` and the page title should be `'Issues · Administrator / janusgraph · GitLab'`.
    - **Actual Outcome:** The `RootWebArea` in USER MESSAGE (step 05) shows `url='http://the-agent-company.com:8929/root/janusgraph/-/issues'` and `title='Issues · Administrator / janusgraph · GitLab'`. This matches the expected outcome.

- **Check 2: Verify the presence of the created issue in the GitLab issues list.**
    - **Verification Method:** Examined the `webpage accessibility tree` from the Task Agent's observation in step 05.
    - **Expected Outcome:** A `link` element with the text `'Research and design new algorithms'` and a corresponding URL like `/root/janusgraph/-/issues/<issue_id>` should be present.
    - **Actual Outcome:** The `webpage accessibility tree` in USER MESSAGE (step 05) contains a `link` element with the text `'Research and design new algorithms'` and the URL `'http://the-agent-company.com:8929/root/janusgraph/-/issues/4659'`. This matches the expected outcome.

Conclusion:
The Subtask "Verify Issues in GitLab" is complete. The Task Agent successfully navigated to the GitLab issues page and confirmed the presence of the newly created issue, as verified by the URL, page title, and the existence of the issue title in the accessibility tree.

Please comprehensively review the entire task execution process, including all subtasks and the contextual information collected.  
Cross-check carefully against the overall task requirements:

1. **Completeness Check**: Ensure every aspect of the requirements has been addressed. Confirm that no items were skipped, postponed, or only partially completed.  
2. **Consistency Check**: Verify that all intermediate results are logically coherent and data-wise consistent with the final conclusions. There should be no contradictions, missing steps, or unexplained gaps.  
3. **Final Completion Confirmation**:  
   - If any requirements remain unfinished or results are insufficient, explicitly list the next subtasks to resolve them.  
   - If all requirements are fully and correctly met, return an empty task plan to indicate the task is completely finished.  

Always remember that your ultimate goal is to complete task:
