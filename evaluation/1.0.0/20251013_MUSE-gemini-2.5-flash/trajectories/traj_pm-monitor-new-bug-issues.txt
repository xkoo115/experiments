Returns a JSON object with `execution_status`, `returncode`, `stdout`, and `stderr`. **Important Precautions**: 1) `returncode=0` does not guarantee successful side effects (e.g., file creation); always verify with independent checks (`ls -l`, `file`). 2) **This tool executes commands in a *minimal* shell environment. Complex shell features like command chaining (`&&`, `||`), pipes (`|`), I/O redirection (`>`, `>>`), and backgrounding (`&`) are often *not reliably interpreted by `run_cmd` directly* and can lead to unexpected behavior or errors (e.g., `SyntaxError`, `command not found`). For any non-trivial shell interaction or complex logic, *always prefer consolidating operations into a single Python script that uses `subprocess` for explicit control and robustness* over multiple `run_cmd` calls or complex shell syntax.** 3) Quote arguments containing spaces (`\"path with spaces\"`). 4) State changes (`cd`) do not persist across calls.", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"command": {"type": "string", "description": "command暂时没有参数描述"}}, "required": ["command"]}}}
</tools>

2. **Python Code Execution**
When executing Python code, please output:
<code>
... your code ...
</code>
- The working directory is `/workspace`
- Executing dangerous, destructive, or time-consuming code is prohibited.
- If both a **Tool Call** and **Python Code Execution** are included in the output, the tool call takes precedence, and the Python code will not be executed.
- Using outdated or limited python libraries may result in incomplete or inaccurate observations (e.g. missing images from PDFs or failing to extract key content). Always prefer robust, modern libraries to ensure full and reliable results.
- When performing file conversion or data extraction, always ensure **data integrity**. Verify that the structure, content, and critical fields of the source file are preserved in the output. Check row and column counts, headers, and key values before and after processing. **Avoid silent loss**, truncation, or unintended alteration of data.

## Action Execution Result Processing
- After each action is executed, an Observation is returned, which includes:
    1. `<tool_response>`: The result of the tool or code execution.
    2. `<tool_instruction>`: The instruction associated with a specific action, used to guide the next step or restrict subsequent behavior.
- **Note**: Do not fabricate observations.

## Security and Restrictions
- **Coding Actions (such as Python, CMD, etc.)**
    - Do not run high-risk operations that are large in code size or take a long time.
    - Do not execute code that could cause data loss, system damage, or irreversible changes.
    - Do not use the kill command with wildcards like * or other dangerous parameters that could result in a wide range of matches.
    - Prefer using the Python interpreter to execute code (safer and more efficient) rather than using the CMD tool.

> ⚠️ **Important**
> When your output contains content that fully conforms to the **Tool Call** or **Python Code Execution** format, the system will immediately parse, identify, and execute it as an **Action** without further confirmation and without reversal.
> Therefore, before outputting, always confirm that this is your **intended** action and fully assess the potential consequences and risks.
> If you are only using **quotes, demonstrations, or examples**, be sure to break the formatting or escape it to prevent the system from interpreting it as a real action.

# OBJECTIVE #
Your core objective is to independently and efficiently complete the tasks assigned to you by the company.


# MEMORY #
During previous tasks, you have accumulated the following reusable knowledge:

## Resolution Patterns
Comprehensive Contextualization: Systematically acquire and aggregate information from diverse, potentially unstructured sources, prioritizing local processing and cross-validation, to ensure a complete, coherent operational view and inform robust decisions.
Robust External Interaction: Prioritize stable, predictable interaction methods, such as structured APIs, and dynamically adapt strategies to ensure continuity and reliability with external systems despite their inconsistencies or volatility.
Adaptive Constraint Handling: When an objective is blocked by an unresolvable external constraint, acknowledge the limitation, perform necessary cleanup of partial artifacts, and adapt the strategy to proceed with viable data, avoiding unproductive retries.
Modular Resilient Design: Decompose operations into modular, decoupled units with explicit state management, to enhance predictability, isolate errors, improve maintainability, and ensure operational continuity.
Progressive Verification: Implement multi-stage validation, from granular checks within pipelines to comprehensive outcome validation, to localize errors, confirm system states, and ensure successful execution.

## Platform/Application Operation Guides
These guides summarize proven operation paths derived from past successful experiences.  
Each item is a structured reference designed to help you complete operations more quickly, accurately, and with reduced redundancy.

> This directory provides a comprehensive index of guides, compiling best practices and experience summaries for accomplishing various tasks.

### Recommended Usage Process
1. **Review the Guide First**  
   Before starting a task, browse the relevant entries in the directory to identify potentially useful guidance.  
2. **Targeted Access**  
   Use the `access_the_application_guide` tool to view detailed steps if necessary.  
3. **Reuse with Flexibility**  
   Apply past successful steps when they fit the current situation, but stay aware of possible mismatches.  
4. **Explore When Deviations Arise**  
   If the environment or results diverge from the guide, stop rigidly following it and explore alternative approaches through small, safe, and adaptive steps.

### Value of Guides
- Reduce task completion time by leveraging accumulated experience.  
- Lower error rates and avoid common pitfalls.  
- Ensure consistent, professional execution of tasks.  

### Guide Reliability & Adaptation
- Guides may be outdated, biased, or contain errors — they are “historical experience,” not absolute truth.  
- Use guides as starting points, not as strict rules.  
- When deviations or conflicts appear, **exit the guide and explore new paths** instead of persisting.  
- Record useful deviation points for later improvement of the guides.

If an `Element index does not exist` error is returned, it indicates extreme element volatility. **Always re-evaluate `webpage interactive elements` with `browser_wait_and_get_update` immediately before attempting a click, and crucially, confirm the element's `text` or `aria-label` attribute semantically matches the intended target.** If direct clicking by index proves unreliable, *especially within dynamic lists or sidebars (e.g., chat contact lists)*, consider alternative strategies like using an application's built-in search functionality or `browser_go_to_url` if a direct link is known, rather than repeatedly retrying. For form submissions or general action triggers, `browser_send_keys` with 'Enter' is a more robust alternative and **highly recommended for reliability**.

Title: GitLab Login Subtask Verification Report

Checklist Details:
- **Check 1: Verify Final URL**
    - Goal: Confirm that the browser's current URL is 'http://the-agent-company.com:8929/'.
    - Finding: The `webpage accessibility tree` in Observation 11 shows the URL as `'http://the-agent-company.com:8929/'`. This matches the expected URL for a successful login.
- **Check 2: Verify Page Title**
    - Goal: Validate that the page title is 'Projects · GitLab'.
    - Finding: The `RootWebArea` in the `webpage accessibility tree` from Observation 11 displays the title as `'Projects · GitLab'`. This confirms the expected page title after a successful login.
- **Check 3: Verify Admin Menu Presence**
    - Goal: Check for the appearance of 'Administrator user’s menu' to confirm administrator login.
    - Finding: The `webpage accessibility tree` in Observation 11 explicitly contains `button 'Administrator user’s menu'`. This verifies that the user is logged in as an administrator.

Conclusion:
All verification checks have passed successfully. The Task Agent has successfully logged into GitLab, navigated to the correct homepage, and the administrator menu is present, fulfilling the objective of the "GitLab Login" subtask. The Subtask is complete.

Successful sending verified by observing `webpage accessibility tree` for the presence of a `paragraph` element containing the message content, typically preceded by `StaticText` for the sender username (e.g., `StaticText 'theagentcompany'`) and a timestamp (e.g., `StaticText '10:28 PM'`). The message input field should also appear cleared after successful sending. For replies, allow additional time for `browser_wait_and_get_update()` (e.g., 5-10 seconds) then analyze `webpage accessibility tree`."}

After accessing, carefully read the guide content. Extract and adapt relevant steps, recognizing that guide information may be outdated or require UI verification. Always prioritize current browser state by performing `browser_wait_and_get_update()` immediately before attempting to follow guide steps.

Thought: I have accessed the guide for `SendMessage`. I am currently in the '#project-ai' channel. I need to construct the message and then send it.

The message should summarize the findings from GitLab. Since no issues were found, the message will state that.

Message content: "GitLab Report for openhands repository (24 September 2024 to 24 October 2024): No open issues labeled 'bug' were found within the specified date range."

I will use `browser_wait_and_get_update` to ensure I have the latest interactive elements, then `browser_input_text` to type the message, and finally `browser_send_keys` with "Enter" to send it.
Action:
<tool_call>
{"name": "browser_wait_and_get_update", "arguments": {}}
</tool_call>
84. | ================================================== USER MESSAGE ==================================================
Observation: 
<tool_response>
Performed browser action: 🕒  Waiting for 3 seconds
The updated browser page status is as follows:
<webpage accessibility tree>[SYSTEM INFO: History accessibility tree removed for brevity]</webpage accessibility tree>
<webpage interactive elements>[SYSTEM INFO: History interactive elements removed for brevity]</webpage interactive elements>

</tool_response>
<tool_instruction>
If a `TimeoutError` occurs, the browser was unresponsive; consider `browser_go_to_url` to reset state. *Crucially, after waiting, always thoroughly analyze the updated `webpage accessibility tree` for the *presence* of expected content or changes (e.g., new chat messages, confirmation dialogs), and critically, for the *accuracy and freshness of interactive element indices* before performing subsequent actions.*
</tool_instruction>

85. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================
Thought: I have successfully waited for the page to update. Now I need to input the message into the message input field. From the `webpage interactive elements`, I can see the message input field at index 63. I will input the message: "GitLab Report for openhands repository (24 September 2024 to 24 October 2024): No open issues labeled 'bug' were found within the specified date range."
Action:
<tool_call>
{"name": "browser_input_text", "arguments": {"index": 63, "text": "GitLab Report for openhands repository (24 September 2024 to 24 October 2024): No open issues labeled 'bug' were found within the specified date range."}}

<tool_instruction>
After inputting text, always use `browser_wait_and_get_update` to verify the text input, check for immediate validation feedback, or confirm any UI changes (e.g., enable/disable buttons, form submission readiness). Be especially mindful of index volatility, as UI changes can rapidly invalidate previously retrieved indices.

After sending keys, *especially when a response or UI change is expected (e.g., chat message sent, form submitted)*, immediately use `browser_wait_and_get_update` to refresh the page state and verify the intended effect (e.g., message displayed, UI updated, data persisted).
</tool_instruction>

89. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================
Thought: I have successfully sent the message to the '#project-ai' channel. The `webpage accessibility tree` now shows a `paragraph` element containing the message I sent, along with the sender's username and a timestamp. This confirms that the message was successfully posted. Therefore, the subtask "Summarize Findings and Post to RocketChat" is complete.
Final Answer: Successfully summarized findings and posted to RocketChat.
