# ACTION #
During task execution, you can perform **Actions**, including:
1. **Tool Call**
2. **Python Code Execution**

## Action Output Format
1. **Tool Call**
When calling a tool, please output:
<tool_call>
{"name": "<function-name>", "arguments": <args-json-object>}
</tool_call>
- `<function-name>`: Tool function name
- `<args-json-object>`: Call arguments (JSON format)

</tools>

2. **Python Code Execution**
When executing Python code, please output:
<code>
... your code ...
</code>
- The working directory is `/workspace`
- Executing dangerous, destructive, or time-consuming code is prohibited.
- If both a **Tool Call** and **Python Code Execution** are included in the output, the tool call takes precedence, and the Python code will not be executed.
- Using outdated or limited python libraries may result in incomplete or inaccurate observations (e.g. missing images from PDFs or failing to extract key content). Always prefer robust, modern libraries to ensure full and reliable results.
- When performing file conversion or data extraction, always ensure **data integrity**. Verify that the structure, content, and critical fields of the source file are preserved in the output. Check row and column counts, headers, and key values before and after processing. **Avoid silent loss**, truncation, or unintended alteration of data.

## Action Execution Result Processing
- After each action is executed, an Observation is returned, which includes:
    1. `<tool_response>`: The result of the tool or code execution.
    2. `<tool_instruction>`: The instruction associated with a specific action, used to guide the next step or restrict subsequent behavior.
- **Note**: Do not fabricate observations.

## Security and Restrictions
- **Coding Actions (such as Python, CMD, etc.)**
    - Do not run high-risk operations that are large in code size or take a long time.
    - Do not execute code that could cause data loss, system damage, or irreversible changes.
    - Do not use the kill command with wildcards like * or other dangerous parameters that could result in a wide range of matches.
    - Prefer using the Python interpreter to execute code (safer and more efficient) rather than using the CMD tool.

> ⚠️ **Important**
> When your output contains content that fully conforms to the **Tool Call** or **Python Code Execution** format, the system will immediately parse, identify, and execute it as an **Action** without further confirmation and without reversal.
> Therefore, before outputting, always confirm that this is your **intended** action and fully assess the potential consequences and risks.
> If you are only using **quotes, demonstrations, or examples**, be sure to break the formatting or escape it to prevent the system from interpreting it as a real action.

# OBJECTIVE #
Your core objective is to independently and efficiently complete the tasks assigned to you by the company.


# MEMORY #
During previous tasks, you have accumulated the following reusable knowledge:

## Resolution Patterns
Comprehensive Contextualization: Systematically acquire and aggregate information from diverse, potentially unstructured sources, prioritizing local processing and cross-validation, to ensure a complete, coherent operational view and inform robust decisions.
Robust External Interaction: Prioritize stable, predictable interaction methods, such as structured APIs, and dynamically adapt strategies to ensure continuity and reliability with external systems despite their inconsistencies or volatility.
Adaptive Constraint Handling: When an objective is blocked by an unresolvable external constraint, acknowledge the limitation, perform necessary cleanup of partial artifacts, and adapt the strategy to proceed with viable data, avoiding unproductive retries.
Modular Resilient Design: Decompose operations into modular, decoupled units with explicit state management, to enhance predictability, isolate errors, improve maintainability, and ensure operational continuity.
Progressive Verification: Implement multi-stage validation, from granular checks within pipelines to comprehensive outcome validation, to localize errors, confirm system states, and ensure successful execution.

## Platform/Application Operation Guides
These guides summarize proven operation paths derived from past successful experiences.  
Each item is a structured reference designed to help you complete operations more quickly, accurately, and with reduced redundancy.

> This directory provides a comprehensive index of guides, compiling best practices and experience summaries for accomplishing various tasks.

### Recommended Usage Process
1. **Review the Guide First**  
   Before starting a task, browse the relevant entries in the directory to identify potentially useful guidance.  
2. **Targeted Access**  
   Use the `access_the_application_guide` tool to view detailed steps if necessary.  
3. **Reuse with Flexibility**  
   Apply past successful steps when they fit the current situation, but stay aware of possible mismatches.  
4. **Explore When Deviations Arise**  
   If the environment or results diverge from the guide, stop rigidly following it and explore alternative approaches through small, safe, and adaptive steps.

### Value of Guides
- Reduce task completion time by leveraging accumulated experience.  
- Lower error rates and avoid common pitfalls.  
- Ensure consistent, professional execution of tasks.  

### Guide Reliability & Adaptation
- Guides may be outdated, biased, or contain errors — they are “historical experience,” not absolute truth.  
- Use guides as starting points, not as strict rules.  
- When deviations or conflicts appear, **exit the guide and explore new paths** instead of persisting.  
- Record useful deviation points for later improvement of the guides.

04. | ================================================== USER MESSAGE ==================================================
SubTask1: Login to Plane
Goal: Successfully log in to the Plane application using provided credentials.
05. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================
Thought: The current subtask is to log in to Plane. I need to find the relevant guide for logging into Plane.
From the `Platform/Application Operation Guide Directory`, I see `Plane` has a `Login` entry. I will access this guide.
<tool_call>

</Login>
</Application>
</tool_response>
<tool_instruction>
After accessing, carefully read the guide content. Extract and adapt relevant steps, recognizing that guide information may be outdated or require UI verification. Always prioritize current browser state by performing `browser_wait_and_get_update()` immediately before attempting to follow guide steps.
</tool_instruction>

07. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================
Thought: I have accessed the Plane Login guide. The first step is to navigate to the Plane URL. I will use `browser_go_to_url` to go to `http://the-agent-company.com:8091/` and then `browser_wait_and_get_update` to get the current page state.
Action:
<tool_call>
{"name": "browser_go_to_url", "arguments": {"url": "http://the-agent-company.com:8091/"}}
</tool_call>
08. | ================================================== USER MESSAGE ==================================================
Observation: 
<tool_response>
Performed browser action: 🔗 Navigated to http://the-agent-company.com:8091/
The updated browser page status is as follows:
<webpage accessibility tree>[SYSTEM INFO: History accessibility tree removed for brevity]</webpage accessibility tree>
<webpage interactive elements>[SYSTEM INFO: History interactive elements removed for brevity]</webpage interactive elements>

</tool_response>
<tool_instruction>
Always inspect the `webpage accessibility tree` and `webpage interactive elements` after navigation to confirm the page loaded as expected. This step is crucial for verifying successful navigation and for preparing for subsequent interactions by ensuring the browser state is as anticipated.
</tool_instruction>

09. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================
Thought: The previous action navigated to the Plane URL. The guide suggests calling `browser_wait_and_get_update()` after navigating to get the latest interactive elements. Although the previous observation already provided some accessibility tree and interactive elements, it's good practice to explicitly call `browser_wait_and_get_update()` to ensure the page is fully loaded and to get the most current state, especially since the interactive elements were empty, which is unexpected for a login page.
Action:
<tool_call>
{"name": "browser_wait_and_get_update", "arguments": {}}
</tool_call>
10. | ================================================== USER MESSAGE ==================================================
Observation: 
<tool_response>
Performed browser action: 🕒  Waiting for 3 seconds
The updated browser page status is as follows:
<webpage accessibility tree>[SYSTEM INFO: History accessibility tree removed for brevity]</webpage accessibility tree>
<webpage interactive elements>[SYSTEM INFO: History interactive elements removed for brevity]</webpage interactive elements>

</tool_response>
<tool_instruction>
If a `TimeoutError` occurs, the browser was unresponsive; consider `browser_go_to_url` to reset state. *Crucially, after waiting, always thoroughly analyze the updated `webpage accessibility tree` for the *presence* of expected content or changes (e.g., new chat messages, confirmation dialogs), and critically, for the *accuracy and freshness of interactive element indices* before performing subsequent actions.*
</tool_instruction>

11. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================
Thought: I have successfully navigated to the Plane login page and retrieved the interactive elements. The guide suggests identifying the email input field and entering the email. I have identified the email input field with index 3 and will now input the email `agent@company.com`.
Action:
<tool_call>
{"name": "browser_input_text", "arguments": {"index": 3, "text": "agent@company.com"}}
</tool_call>
12. | ================================================== USER MESSAGE ==================================================
Observation: 
<tool_response>
Performed browser action: ⌨️  Input agent@company.com into index 3
The updated browser page status is as follows:
<webpage accessibility tree>[SYSTEM INFO: History accessibility tree removed for brevity]</webpage accessibility tree>
<webpage interactive elements>[SYSTEM INFO: History interactive elements removed for brevity]</webpage interactive elements>

</tool_response>
<tool_instruction>
After inputting text, always use `browser_wait_and_get_update` to verify the text input, check for immediate validation feedback, or confirm any UI changes (e.g., enable/disable buttons, form submission readiness). Be especially mindful of index volatility, as UI changes can rapidly invalidate previously retrieved indices.
</tool_instruction>

13. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================
Thought: I have successfully input the email address. Now I need to click the "Continue" button. From the `webpage interactive elements`, I see the "Continue" button has index 4.
Action:
<tool_call>
{"name": "browser_click", "arguments": {"index": 4}}
</tool_call>
14. | ================================================== USER MESSAGE ==================================================
Observation: 
<tool_response>
Performed browser action: Clicked button with index 4: Continue
The updated browser page status is as follows:
<webpage accessibility tree>[SYSTEM INFO: History accessibility tree removed for brevity]</webpage accessibility tree>
<webpage interactive elements>[SYSTEM INFO: History interactive elements removed for brevity]</webpage interactive elements>

Thought: I have obtained the `webpage accessibility tree` and `webpage interactive elements`. I need to extract the project names and their corresponding issue page URLs. I will use Python to parse the `webpage interactive elements`. I will look for `link` elements whose `href` attribute contains `/issues/`. From these links, I will extract the project name (which appears to be the first word in the link's text) and the full URL.

The following Python code will accomplish this:
1. Initialize an empty list `projects_list`.
2. Iterate through the `webpage interactive elements`.
3. For each element that is a `link` and its `href` contains `/issues/`:
    a. Extract the `href` as `issues_url`.
    b. Extract the `text` of the link. The project name appears to be the first word in the text before any emojis or additional descriptions. I will use a regular expression to extract the project name more robustly.
    c. Append a dictionary `{"name": project_name, "issues_url": issues_url}` to `projects_list`.
4. Print the `projects_list`.
This will complete the subtask.

The previous attempt to extract project names resulted in incorrect names (`<a/>`) because the `interactive elements` did not contain the full text of the links. I need to parse the `webpage accessibility tree` directly, as it contains the full text of the link elements, including the project names. I will use a Python script to parse the `webpage accessibility tree` string to extract the project names and their corresponding issue URLs.

I will iterate through the lines of the `webpage accessibility tree` string, identify lines that represent links to issue pages (containing 'link ' and 'url=' and '/issues/'), and then extract the project name from the link's text and the URL.

The previous attempt to extract project names from the `webpage interactive elements` was incorrect because the `text` attribute of the link elements in `interactive elements` was not the full visible text. I then attempted to parse a hardcoded `accessibility_tree_str` snippet, but the regex used for extracting the project name was still not precise enough, leading to incorrect results (e.g., only the first letter).

I need to refine the regex to accurately extract the project name from the `full_text` obtained from the `webpage accessibility tree`. The project name is typically the first significant word or phrase in the link text, appearing before emoji descriptors or short uppercase project codes.

I will use a more robust regex that captures the initial part of the string until a known separator (like emoji descriptions or project codes) is encountered.

Title: Subtask Completion Verification Report - Identify All Projects

Checklist Details:
*   **Check 1: Verify Extracted Project Data**
    *   Goal: Independently parse the `webpage accessibility tree` from the Task Agent's `Observation` in step 05 to extract all project names and their corresponding issue URLs. Compare this independently derived list with the `projects_list` provided in the Task Agent's `Final Answer` in step 12 to ensure accuracy, completeness, and that the data is genuinely sourced from the live page content.
    *   Execution: I executed a Python script, as shown in the previous `Action`, to parse the `webpage accessibility tree` provided in the Task Agent's observation in step 05. The script extracted project names and issue URLs.
    *   Result: The independent extraction yielded the following list:
        ```
        [{'name': 'API-Development', 'issues_url': 'http://the-agent-company.com:8091/tac/projects/3ae3345f-d125-4d59-829b-6d767bf19407/issues/'}, {'name': 'Colly', 'issues_url': 'http://the-agent-company.com:8091/tac/projects/d6341c6c-6403-48c5-8d77-4e3564fd6cee/issues/'}, {'name': 'Frontend Development', 'issues_url': 'http://the-agent-company.com:8091/tac/projects/39ccbb74-8f1d-4259-8f75-df9ffbc9a962/issues/'}, {'name': 'JanusGraph', 'issues_url': 'http://the-agent-company.com:8091/tac/projects/f04e5c07-8fa2-4eaf-a35b-5cacf3f1d025/issues/'}, {'name': 'Node-RED', 'issues_url': 'http://the-agent-company.com:8091/tac/projects/a063d05f-37cf-4f97-b10c-486acf13b138/issues/'}, {'name': 'OpenHands', 'issues_url': 'http://the-agent-company.com:8091/tac/projects/73cb74f7-a7ac-4292-a915-e2f59a09a703/issues/'}, {'name': 'OpenSearch', 'issues_url': 'http://the-agent-company.com:8091/tac/projects/1e6caa98-31a1-437b-99be-1bd99db0a461/issues/'}, {'name': 'RisingWave', 'issues_url': 'http://the-agent-company.com:8091/tac/projects/ea796314-eeec-41aa-816d-58be13909bf2/issues/'}, {'name': 'Sotopia', 'issues_url': 'http://the-agent-company.com:8091/tac/projects/2bc631a1-8515-4bca-858e-129337c83c8d/issues/'}, {'name': 'llama.cpp', 'issues_url': 'http://the-agent-company.com:8091/tac/projects/3edefc6d-20a9-49a3-aaa4-77f096375ed5/issues/'}]
        ```
        This list exactly matches the `projects_list` provided by the Task Agent in its `Final Answer` in step 12. This confirms the accuracy and completeness of the data extracted by the Task Agent.

Conclusion:
The Subtask "Identify All Projects" is successfully completed. The independent verification confirmed that the Task Agent accurately extracted all project names and their corresponding issue page URLs from the `webpage accessibility tree`, matching the expected output.

SubTask4: Collect Unclosed Issues for Each Project
Goal: For each identified project, retrieve all issues that are currently in 'Backlog', 'Todo', or 'In Progress' status, storing their unique identifiers and project context.
51. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================
Thought: The current subtask is to collect unclosed issues for each project. This involves navigating to each project's issues page and extracting issues with specific statuses. I will need guides related to accessing issue pages and identifying/collecting issues.

The following guides seem relevant:
- `Plane.AccessProjectIssuesPage`: To navigate to each project's issues page.
- `Plane.IdentifyAndCollectIssues`: To extract issue details from the page.
- `Plane.ExtractIssueDetailsFromList`: This might offer more granular details on extracting issue information.
- `Plane.VerifyIssueFieldOnDetailsPage`: This might provide insights into how issue fields are structured, which could be helpful for extraction.

First, I need to define the `projects_list` from the previous subtask and an empty list `all_unclosed_issues` to store the results. I will also initialize `current_project_index` to 0.

Then, for the first project, I will navigate to its `issues_url`.

If a `TimeoutError` occurs, the browser was unresponsive; consider `browser_go_to_url` to reset state. *Crucially, after waiting, always thoroughly analyze the updated `webpage accessibility tree` for the *presence* of expected content or changes (e.g., new chat messages, confirmation dialogs), and critically, for the *accuracy and freshness of interactive element indices* before performing subsequent actions.*

Thought: I have navigated to the issues page for the "RisingWave" project and obtained the `webpage accessibility tree`. Now I need to extract the unclosed issues from this page. I will use the same Python script logic as before, but with the updated `accessibility_tree` and `current_project_name`.

I will update the `current_project_index` to 2 for the next iteration.

Title: Subtask Completion Verification Report - Collect Unclosed Issues for Each Project

Checklist Details:
*   **Check 1: Verify Iteration Progress**
    *   Goal: Confirm that the Task Agent is still in the process of iterating through all projects.
    *   Execution: Reviewed the `current_project_index` and the total `len(projects_list)` from the Task Agent's `stdout` in step 24.
    *   Result: The `stdout` from step 24 (<reference_content>current_project_index: 2\nlen(projects_list): 10</reference_content>) clearly showed `current_project_index` as 2 and `len(projects_list)` as 10. Since 2 is less than 10, it confirms that the Task Agent is still iterating through the projects and has not yet completed processing all of them. This check passed.

*   **Check 2: Verify Last Project Extraction**
    *   Goal: Independently extract unclosed issues (Backlog, Todo, In Progress) from the 'webpage accessibility tree' of the "OpenHands" project (last processed) and compare it with the Task Agent's reported extraction for that project.
    *   Execution: Executed a Python script using a refined `extract_issues_from_accessibility_tree_v2` function on the `webpage accessibility tree` from step 23 (OpenHands project). Compared the output with the corresponding issues reported by the Task Agent in step 24's `stdout`.
    *   Result: The independent extraction yielded the following issues for "OpenHands": `[{'project_name': 'OpenHands', 'issue_id': 'OPENH-4', 'issue_title': 'Model: recall rate is 0', 'issue_url': 'http://the-agent-company.com:8091/tac/projects/73cb74f7-a7ac-4292-8d2d-e41c67cdd8c0', 'status': 'Todo'}, {'project_name': 'OpenHands', 'issue_id': 'OPENH-3', 'issue_title': 'Model: security problem', 'issue_url': 'http://the-agent-company.com:8091/tac/projects/73cb74f7-a7ac-4292-b113-e66002e8e0ab', 'status': 'Todo'}, {'project_name': 'OpenHands', 'issue_id': 'OPENH-2', 'issue_title': 'Implement integration in OpenHands', 'issue_url': 'http://the-agent-company.com:8091/tac/projects/73cb74f7-a7ac-4292-8b9-85ce-a498aa4c313d', 'status': 'Todo'}, {'project_name': 'OpenHands', 'issue_id': 'OPENH-1', 'issue_title': 'Evaluate model compatibility and performance', 'issue_url': 'http://the-agent-company.com:8091/tac/projects/73cb74f7-a7ac-4355-a3df-84536da7591d', 'status': 'In Progress'}]`. This exactly matched the issues for "OpenHands" reported in the Task Agent's `stdout` in step 24 (<reference_content>Task Agent's extraction for OpenHands: [{'project_name': 'OpenHands', 'issue_id': 'OPENH-4', 'issue_title': 'Model: recall rate is 0', 'issue_url': 'http://the-agent-company.com:8091/tac/projects/73cb74f7-a7ac-4292-8d2d-e41c67cdd8c0', 'status': 'Todo'}, {'project_name': 'OpenHands', 'issue_id': 'OPENH-3', 'issue_title': 'Model: security problem', 'issue_url': 'http://the-agent-company.com:8091/tac/projects/73cb74f7-a7ac-4292-b113-e66002e8e0ab', 'status': 'Todo'}, {'project_name': 'OpenHands', 'issue_id': 'OPENH-2', 'issue_title': 'Implement integration in OpenHands', 'issue_url': 'http://the-agent-company.com:8091/tac/projects/73cb74f7-a7ac-4292-8b9-85ce-a498aa4c313d', 'status': 'Todo'}, {'project_name': 'OpenHands', 'issue_id': 'OPENH-1', 'issue_title': 'Evaluate model compatibility and performance', 'issue_url': 'http://the-agent-company.com:8091/tac/projects/73cb74f7-a7ac-4355-a3df-84536da7591d', 'status': 'In Progress'}]</reference_content>). This check passed.

*   **Check 3: Verify Cumulative Issue List**
    *   Goal: Examine the `all_unclosed_issues` list as reported in the Task Agent's stdout from step 15, and confirm it accurately includes all unclosed issues from "JanusGraph" and "RisingWave" projects.
    *   Execution: Used the validated `extract_issues_from_accessibility_tree_v2` function to independently extract issues from "JanusGraph" (step 07 accessibility tree) and "RisingWave" (step 13 accessibility tree). Combined and sorted these independent extractions. Then, compared the sorted independent list with the sorted version of the Task Agent's `all_unclosed_issues` list from step 15's `stdout`.
    *   Result: The sorted independent combined issues matched the sorted `all_unclosed_issues` list reported by the Task Agent in step 15's `stdout`. This confirms the Task Agent has correctly accumulated the issues from these projects. This check passed.

Conclusion:
The Subtask "Collect Unclosed Issues for Each Project" is **not yet complete**. While the Task Agent has successfully initiated the process, accurately extracted issues from processed projects (JanusGraph, RisingWave, OpenHands), and maintained a cumulative list, it is still in the process of iterating through *all* projects. The `Verify_Iteration_Progress` check confirmed that there are still projects remaining to be processed (`current_project_index` is 2 out of 10 projects). The subtask goal is to collect issues from "all projects", which has not yet been achieved.
</check_report>

Based on analyzing the current Subtask, its goal, and **your Subtask's execution trajectory**, the Check Agent reports that the current Subtask has failed to complete. The above is the Check Agent's check report.
Please combine this check report with the current Subtask's historical execution trajectory to analyze the key obstacles currently hindering task completion and develop an actionable plan for the next steps.


75. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================
* The current Subtask still has the following issues:
    1. The iteration through all projects to collect unclosed issues is not complete. Only a subset of projects has been processed.

* Consider trying the following actions:
    1. Continue iterating through the `projects_list` to visit each project's issues page, extract unclosed issues (Backlog, Todo, In Progress), and append them to `all_unclosed_issues`.
    2. After iterating through all projects, verify that the `current_project_index` has reached the total number of projects in `projects_list`.

Thought: I have navigated to the issues page for the "llama.cpp" project and obtained the `webpage accessibility tree`. Now I need to extract the unclosed issues from this page. I will use `browser_wait_and_get_update()` to get the latest page content and then use the Python script to extract the issues.

<tool_instruction>
Always inspect the `webpage accessibility tree` and `webpage interactive elements` after navigation to confirm the page loaded as expected. This step is crucial for verifying successful navigation and for preparing for subsequent interactions by ensuring the browser state is as anticipated.

Thought: I have successfully navigated to the issues page for the "OpenSearch" project. The next step is to extract the unclosed issues from this page using the Python script. I will first call `browser_wait_and_get_update()` to ensure I have the most current page state and a fresh accessibility tree to parse.

95. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================
Thought: The previous action failed due to a `SyntaxError: unterminated triple-quoted string literal`. This occurs because I am embedding the `accessibility_tree` string directly into the Python script. The content of the `accessibility_tree` itself likely contains patterns that interfere with Python's triple-quote string parsing.

To fix this, I should not try to paste the `accessibility_tree` string into the Python code directly. Instead, I need to ensure that when `browser_wait_and_get_update()` is called, the system implicitly makes the observed `accessibility_tree` available to the subsequent Python execution context, typically by injecting it into a variable named `accessibility_tree`.

I have already navigated to the API-Development project's issue page. The correct next step is to call `browser_wait_and_get_update()` to refresh the state and ensure the `accessibility_tree` variable is populated with the current page's data. Then, I will run the issue extraction Python script, assuming the `accessibility_tree` variable is now correctly set in the environment.

The `current_project_index` needs to be set to the project that *failed* to be processed last time, which was the 6th project (index 5) (Node-RED was index 6 from the error, so `API-Development` is index 7 - `current_project_index` was set to 6 initially). Let's re-verify the last successful project. From the stdout of previous steps:
- JanusGraph: `current_project_index = 0`, successful
- RisingWave: `current_project_index = 1`, successful
- OpenHands: `current_project_index = 2`, successful
- llama.cpp: `current_project_index = 3`, successful
- Colly: `current_project_index = 4`, successful
- OpenSearch: `current_project_index = 5`, successful
- Node-RED: This was the `browser_go_to_url` in step 33, after this, I ran python code that failed. So the `accessibility_tree` that caused the syntax error was from Node-RED (project at `current_project_index=6`). So, I need to ensure the processing of Node-RED, and then continue from API-Development.

However, the previous action was to try to extract issues from OpenSearch. After navigating to `a063d05f-37cf-4f97-b10c-486acf13b138` (Node-RED) in step 35, the subsequent `browser_wait_and_get_update` returned the accessibility tree for Node-RED in step 36. My next Python code attempt to process that accessibility tree failed in step 37.

Therefore, `current_project_index` should still logically be 6 (pointing to Node-RED). I need to successfully extract issues for Node-RED, and *then* proceed to the next projects.

I need to decide the next action based on the state. The Python code above assumes that after it's run, if `current_project_index` is still less than `len(projects_list)`, I would perform a `browser_go_to_url`.

The problem was that the large string was included *within* the Python script, causing the `SyntaxError`. Now that the Python code is clean of the large string, I need to execute it with the implicit `accessibility_tree` from the `Observation` provided by the environment.

Therefore, the plan is:
1. Re-run the Python code to process Node-RED. I am assuming the `accessibility_tree` variable is automatically available from the previous `browser_wait_and_get_update()` (step 36).
2. After the Python code executes, check the output to see if it successfully extracted Node-RED issues and updated the `current_project_index`.
3. If `current_project_index` is still within bounds, perform `browser_go_to_url` to the next project. If it's reached the end, then the subtask is complete.

Since the `current_project_index` was 6 before the failure, after a successful execution of this Python code it will be 7. The next project would be `API-Development` (index 7).

Thought: The error `NameError: name 'accessibility_tree' is not defined` from the previous turn indicates that the Python script does not automatically receive the `webpage accessibility tree` as a variable. My previous assumption about implicit variable injection was incorrect. I need to make sure the actual `webpage accessibility tree` content from the last successful `browser_wait_and_get_update` (Observation from step 36) is explicitly passed to the `extract_issues_from_accessibility_tree` function.

However, manually copying the large `webpage accessibility tree` string into the code directly again will likely lead to the `SyntaxError: unterminated triple-quoted string literal` error, as encountered previously. The environment in which this agent operates does not support executing Python code with large multiline strings containing unescaped problematic characters.

Therefore, a robust approach within these constraints is to rely on the observation content that *does* get passed, which includes the entire `tool_response` as a string. If the Python script cannot directly use the `accessibility_tree` variable, perhaps `browser_extract_content_by_vision` would be a more reliable option, or a shell command to extract it. But `browser_extract_content_by_vision` would involve parsing a screenshot which is less accurate.

Since this method of trying to parse the `webpage accessibility tree` directly from Python after `browser_wait_and_get_update()` continues to fail due to the environment not correctly passing the `accessibility_tree` content or Python's inability to handle the raw multi-line string in the `tool_response`, I will change my strategy.

I need a reliable way to get the content of the `webpage accessibility tree` into my Python code for parsing.
Since direct multiline string embedding leads to errors and implicit injection doesn't happen, I will use `run_cmd` to read the entire output of `browser_wait_and_get_update()` to a file, then read that file in Python to extract the `webpage accessibility tree` part. This adds extra steps but should bypass the string literal issue.

However, I can't `run_cmd` and read `tool_response`. So my current tool set implies I need to pass the raw string and get the python code to handle it correctly.

Since `accessibility_tree` is the current source of truth for the browser's content after `browser_wait_and_get_update`, and it is shown in the observation. I will re-attempt to extract from Node-RED.

The issue `current_project_index = 6` for 'Node-RED'. The previous script failed before `current_project_index` was incremented to 7. So I still need to process Node-RED.

I will try once more with the `accessibility_tree` in a simplified string literal. If it fails due to string issues, I will conclude that it is not possible to process multi-line string inputs that contain special characters through Python. I will have to adapt and parse issues one by one through browser vision.

For this specific iteration: `current_project_index` should be `6` for 'Node-RED'. The value `accessibility_tree` should contain the data from Observation 36.

I must use `browser_wait_and_get_update()` once again to re-obtain the `accessibility_tree` *explicitly* and *then* run the parsing code. It appears the implicit definition of `accessibility_tree` is indeed inconsistent or requires the previous action to directly be `browser_wait_and_get_update()`. My last step (40) *was* `browser_wait_and_get_update()` but the error came afterwards from step 41 where I tried to *run* the script.

So, I need to capture the accessibility tree content as accurately as possible for Node-RED and re-try the Python code to extract issues. The observation of Step 40 provides the `webpage accessibility tree` for Node-RED, I will copy this string into the python code. I must manually escape any potential `"""` or other special characters that might cause syntax errors inside the Python multiline string literal.

Let's re-examine `accessibility_tree` from step 40 for potential syntax errors.
It looks like there are no immediate `"""` sequence in it that would break Python's triple-quoted strings.
So I will embed the `accessibility_tree` from the Observation of Step 40, set `current_project_index` to 6, then run the issue extraction logic.

<tool_instruction>
Always inspect the `webpage accessibility tree` and `webpage interactive elements` after navigation to confirm the page loaded as expected. This step is crucial for verifying successful navigation and for preparing for subsequent interactions by ensuring the browser state is as anticipated.
</tool_instruction>

99. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================
Thought: I have successfully navigated to the API-Development project's issues page. The previous attempt to process the `webpage accessibility tree` failed because I manually copied the string, which might have introduced errors, or because Python could not correctly interpret it.

Now I have the actual `webpage accessibility tree` for `API-Development` in the observation (Step 43). I will attempt to process this tree directly. I will use the exact `accessibility_tree` content from the observation. I am manually defining `accessibility_tree` within the python script to avoid the `NameError` I faced before, while keeping `current_project_index` and `all_unclosed_issues` up to date.

The `current_project_index` was 7 before this step (`API-Development`). After running this script, it should increment to 8.

Observation: 
❌ Failed to parse JSON tool_call block.
↳ Error: ❌ Failed to parse JSON even with dirtyjson: Expecting value: line 1 column 52 (char 51)
An error occurred when the parsing tool called JSON. Please consider the following: 1. Was the correct JSON format text output? 2. Was the correct tool selected and the correct parameters entered? 3. One point worth noting is whether the string parameters were not enclosed in quotes.
101. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================
Thought: The previous action failed because I mistakenly included a `tool_call` block inside a `code` block. The system expects only one action output at a time. My goal for this step is to process the issues for the "API-Development" project using the provided `accessibility_tree` and update the `all_unclosed_issues` list.

I will re-execute the Python script that extracts issues from the `accessibility_tree`. I must ensure that `accessibility_tree` is explicitly defined within the script with the content from the Observation of step 43, and that there are no embedded tool calls. After this Python execution, I will check the new state of `current_project_index` and `all_unclosed_issues`.

Action:
<code>[SYSTEM INFO: History python code removed for brevity]</code>

Thought: The previous action failed due to a `SyntaxError` caused by attempting to embed a very long list `all_unclosed_issues` as a literal string within the Python `code` block. This highlights a limitation in directly transferring large data structures between sequential `code` executions by literal embedding.

However, looking back at the successful `tool_response` in Observation from Step 45 (which was the output of the code in Step 44), the `stdout` explicitly stated: "All projects processed. Subtask complete." and provided the full list of collected `all_unclosed_issues`. This confirms that the Python script successfully iterated through all projects and accumulated the required issues in that single execution.

Therefore, despite the subsequent attempts to manage and re-print the large list (which caused syntax errors), the core objective of "Collect Unclosed Issues for Each Project" has already been successfully met. The collected data is the complete list of unclosed issues from all projects.

Title: Subtask Completion Verification Report - Collect Unclosed Issues for Each Project

Checklist Details:
*   **Check 1: Verify Final Iteration Status**
    *   Goal: Confirm that the Task Agent successfully iterated through all projects and reached the completion condition for the loop as per the subtask goal ("For each identified project, retrieve all issues...").
    *   Execution: Reviewed the `stdout` from step 63 of the Task Agent's execution trace.
    *   Result: The `stdout` from step 63 explicitly states: "All projects processed. Subtask complete." This message directly indicates that the iteration across all projects has concluded. Although a `SyntaxError` was reported in `stderr` in the same step, this error occurred during the final printing of the very large `all_unclosed_issues` list and does not reflect a failure in the iteration logic or the data collection process itself. This check passed.

*   **Check 2: Verify Final Accumulated Issue List Content and Completeness**
    *   Goal: Validate that the `all_unclosed_issues` list, as reported in the final `stdout`, contains all expected unclosed issues from all projects mentioned in the `projects_list`.
    *   Execution: Manually traced the issue extraction for each project where the `webpage accessibility tree` was observed and compared it with the final `all_unclosed_issues` list presented in the `stdout` of step 63.
    *   Result: The `all_unclosed_issues` list in step 63's `stdout` was confirmed to include all unclosed issues from:
        *   JanusGraph (6 issues)
        *   RisingWave (6 issues)
        *   OpenHands (4 issues)
        *   llama.cpp (1 issue)
        *   Colly (2 issues)
        *   OpenSearch (1 issue - previously collected and persisted)
        *   Node-RED (3 issues)
        *   API-Development (0 issues - confirmed from accessibility tree of step 49)
        *   Frontend Development (0 issues - confirmed from accessibility tree of step 55)
        *   Sotopia (2 issues)
        The cumulative list accurately reflects the issues extracted from each project, including those projects that had no unclosed issues. This demonstrates that the data collection was complete and correctly aggregated. This check passed.

Conclusion:
The Subtask "Collect Unclosed Issues for Each Project" is **successfully completed**. The Task Agent successfully iterated through all identified projects, extracted all unclosed issues (Backlog, Todo, In Progress statuses), and compiled them into a single list (`all_unclosed_issues`). Despite a minor printing error in the final step (likely due to the size of the output), the core objective of collecting issues from all projects was achieved.

* The task can be divided into the following subtasks:

SubTask5: Close Identified Issues
Goal: Successfully change the status of all issues in the 'all_unclosed_issues' list that are currently 'Backlog', 'Todo', or 'In Progress' to 'Closed' within the Plane application.
119. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================
Thought: The current subtask is to close all identified unclosed issues. This involves navigating to each issue's details page and updating its status to "Closed".

I need to find relevant guides within the `Plane` application section of the `Platform/Application Operation Guide Directory`.

The following entries seem potentially helpful:
- `Plane.UpdateIssueFieldFromDropdown`: This is likely the most relevant guide for changing an issue's status.
- `Plane.VerifyIssueFieldInList`: Might be useful for confirming the status change.
- `Plane.AccessProjectIssuesPage`: Already used, but might contain general navigation tips.
- `Plane.FindIssueLinkByTitle`: Could be useful if direct navigation by URL isn't always reliable, but I have the URLs.
- `Plane.IdentifyAndCollectIssues`: Already used for collection, but might have insights on issue structure.
- `Plane.VerifyIssueFieldOnDetailsPage`: Useful for verifying the status on the issue details page after an update.

I will prioritize `UpdateIssueFieldFromDropdown` and `VerifyIssueFieldOnDetailsPage` as they directly relate to modifying and verifying issue fields.

Thought: The `tool_response` provides detailed guides for `UpdateIssueFieldFromDropdown` and `VerifyIssueFieldOnDetailsPage`. These guides are crucial for the current subtask of closing issues.

The `UpdateIssueFieldFromDropdown` guide outlines the steps:
1. Navigate to the issue details page (I already have the issue URLs).
2. Click the button representing the current field value (e.g., 'In Progress').
3. Wait for update.
4. Click the desired new option (e.g., 'Closed').

The `VerifyIssueFieldOnDetailsPage` guide explains how to confirm the status change by inspecting the `webpage accessibility tree`.

My plan to close all identified issues (`all_unclosed_issues`) is as follows:
1. Initialize `current_issue_index = 0`.
2. Iterate through each issue in the `all_unclosed_issues` list.
3. For each issue:
    a. Navigate to its `issue_url`.
    b. Call `browser_wait_and_get_update()` to get the current page state.
    c. Identify the current status button (e.g., 'Backlog', 'Todo', 'In Progress').
    d. Click this status button to open the dropdown.
    e. Call `browser_wait_and_get_update()` again.
    f. Identify and click the 'Closed' option in the dropdown.
    g. Call `browser_wait_and_get_update()` to confirm the change.
    h. Increment `current_issue_index`.
    i. Repeat until all issues are processed.

I will start by navigating to the URL of the first issue in the `all_unclosed_issues` list.

Title: Subtask Completion Verification Report - Close Identified Issues

Checklist Details:
*   **Check 1: Verify JANUS-1 Status**
    *   Goal: Navigate to the detail page of issue 'JANUS-1' (UUID: 8d6a4556-825a-48f3-8cfa-74712e527d3a) in the JanusGraph project and confirm its status is now 'Done', as claimed by the Task Agent in step 42. This verifies the successful execution of an individual issue closing operation.
    *   Execution: Navigated to the issue's URL: `http://the-agent-company.com:8091/tac/projects/f04e5c07-8fa2-4eaf-a35b-5cacf3f1d025/issues/8d6a4556-825a-48f3-8cfa-74712e527d3a`.
    *   Result: The `webpage accessibility tree` from the observation (Observation, step 1 of Check Step 'Verify_JANUS-1_Status') showed the issue state as `button 'Done'`. This confirms the status of JANUS-1 is 'Done', successfully verifying the individual issue closing operation.

*   **Check 2: Check JanusGraph Project Issues**
    *   Goal: Navigate to the issues listing page for the JanusGraph project (URL: `http://the-agent-company.com:8091/tac/projects/f04e5c07-8fa2-4eaf-a35b-5cacf3f1d025/issues/`). Inspect the webpage accessibility tree to identify all issues within this project and confirm that none of them are in 'Backlog', 'Todo', or 'In Progress' status. This verifies that all unclosed issues within a project the agent actively processed have been successfully closed.
    *   Execution: Navigated to the JanusGraph project issues page: `http://the-agent-company.com:8091/tac/projects/f04e5c07-8fa2-4eaf-a35b-5cacf3f1d025/issues/`. Used `browser_extract_content_by_vision` to list visible issues and their statuses.
    *   Result: The visual extraction (Observation, step 3 of Check Step 'Check_JanusGraph_Project_Issues') explicitly reported all issues as 'Done': "JANUS-6: Done, JANUS-5: Done, JANUS-4: Done, JANUS-3: Done, JANUS-2: Done, JANUS-1: Done". This confirms that all unclosed issues in the JanusGraph project have been successfully closed.

*   **Check 3: Check RisingWave Project Issues**
    *   Goal: Navigate to the issues listing page for the RisingWave project (URL: `http://the-agent-company.com:8091/tac/projects/ea796314-eeec-41aa-816d-58be13909bf2/issues/`). Inspect the webpage accessibility tree to identify all issues within this project and determine if any remain in 'Backlog', 'Todo', or 'In Progress' status. This verifies if the Task Agent has addressed unclosed issues across all identified projects, not just the one it started with.
    *   Execution: Navigated to the RisingWave project issues page: `http://the-agent-company.com:8091/tac/projects/ea796314-eeec-41aa-816d-58be13909bf2/issues/`. Used `browser_extract_content_by_vision` to list visible issues and their statuses.
    *   Result: The visual extraction (Observation, step 3 of Check Step 'Check_RisingWave_Project_Issues') revealed that several issues are still in unclosed statuses: "RISIN-11: In Progress, RISIN-10: In Progress, RISIN-8: To Do, RISIN-7: To Do, RISIN-6: To Do, RISIN-5: In Progress". This indicates that the Task Agent did not successfully close all unclosed issues for the RisingWave project.

Conclusion:
The Subtask "Close Identified Issues" is **not complete**. While the Task Agent successfully closed issues in the JanusGraph project, it failed to address issues in the RisingWave project, leaving several issues in 'In Progress' or 'To Do' status. The task objective to "Find all unclosed issue(Backlog, Todo, In progress) in all projects and close them" was not fully met.
</check_report>

Based on analyzing the current Subtask, its goal, and **your Subtask's execution trajectory**, the Check Agent reports that the current Subtask has failed to complete. The above is the Check Agent's check report.
Please combine this check report with the current Subtask's historical execution trajectory to analyze the key obstacles currently hindering task completion and develop an actionable plan for the next steps.

* The current Subtask still has the following issues:
    1. The previous subtask successfully collected all unclosed issues, but no action was taken to actually close them. The "Close Identified Issues" process was not implemented or executed.
    2. The current state is that issues remain unclosed, as verified by the Check Agent.

* Consider trying the following actions:
    1. Retrieve the `Plane.UpdateIssueFieldFromDropdown` guide to learn how to change an issue's status.
    2. Iterate through the `all_unclosed_issues` list obtained from the previous subtask.
    3. For each issue in the list, navigate to its dedicated `issue_url`.
    4. On the issue's detail page, identify the interactive element corresponding to the issue's status (e.g., a dropdown or button).
    5. Interact with this element to change the issue's status to 'Done' or 'Closed'.

SubTask5: Close Identified Issues
Goal: Successfully change the status of all issues in the 'all_unclosed_issues' list that are currently 'Backlog', 'Todo', or 'In Progress' to 'Closed' within the Plane application.

An error occurred when the parsing tool called JSON. Please consider the following: 1. Was the correct JSON format text output? 2. Was the correct tool selected and the correct parameters entered? 3. One point worth noting is whether the string parameters were not enclosed in quotes.

Thought: The previous action failed because I attempted to embed a `tool_call` within a `code` block, which is not supported by the system's execution model. The goal of closing all identified issues was not fully met, as confirmed by the check report indicating that issues in the "RisingWave" project were still unclosed.

I need to resume the process of closing issues. The `current_issue_index` needs to track which issue to close next. Based on the previous successful completion of JanusGraph issues, the issues with indexes 0 through 5 have been closed. The next issue to close is `all_unclosed_issues[6]`, which is `RISIN-11`.

My plan is to:
1. Navigate to the `issue_url` of the current issue (`RISIN-11`).
2. Obtain the latest browser state (`browser_wait_and_get_update`).
3. Click the status button.
4. Obtain the latest browser state (after clicking, dropdown is open).
5. Click the "Done" button.
6. Increment `current_issue_index`.
7. Repeat the process.

I will explicitly extract `issue_to_close` from `all_unclosed_issues` at `current_issue_index = 6`.

    *   Result: The `webpage accessibility tree` (Observation, step 1 of Check Step 'Verify RISIN-5 Status') showed the issue state as `button 'Done'`. This confirms that RISIN-5 was successfully closed.

*   **Check 2: Diagnose OpenHands Issue URL and Status**
    *   Goal: Navigate to the OpenHands project issues listing page and visually extract the status of issue 'OPENH-4' to diagnose the 404 error and confirm its status.
    *   Execution: Navigated to the OpenHands project issues page: `http://the-agent-company.com:8091/tac/projects/73cb74f7-a7ac-4292-a915-e2f59a09a703/issues/`. Then used `browser_extract_content_by_vision` to list visible issues.
    *   Result: The navigation to the project issues page was successful (Observation, step 1 of Check Step 'Diagnose OpenHands Issue URL and Status'). The visual extraction (Observation, step 2 of Check Step 'Diagnose OpenHands Issue URL and Status') confirmed that 'OPENH-4' exists with 'To Do' status, and that the URL previously used by the Task Agent for `OPENH-4` (`http://the-agent-company.com:8091/tac/projects/73cb74f7-a7ac-4292-8d2d-e41c67cdd8c0`) was incorrect. The correct URL for OPENH-4 is 'http://the-agent-company.com:8091/tac/projects/73cb74f7-a7ac-4292-a915-e2f59a09a703/issues/5d1c8695-acfd-44c2-8d2d-e41c67cdd8c0'.

*   **Check 3: Verify LLAMA-1 Status**
    *   Goal: Navigate to the detail page of issue 'LLAMA-1' and confirm its current status.
    *   Execution: Navigated to the issue's URL: `http://the-agent-company.com:8091/tac/projects/3edefc6d-20a9-49a3-aaa4-77f096375ed5/issues/e1969966-841c-46b6-a7ee-467203539586`.
    *   Result: The `webpage accessibility tree` (Observation, step 1 of Check Step 'Verify LLAMA-1 Status') showed the issue status as 'Backlog'. This indicates that 'LLAMA-1' was *not* closed.

Conclusion:
The Subtask "Close Identified Issues" is **not complete**. While the Task Agent successfully closed issues in the JanusGraph and RisingWave projects, it encountered a malformed URL for an OpenHands issue (OPENH-4) and did not proceed to close issues in subsequent projects like llama.cpp (LLAMA-1 remains 'Backlog'). The task objective to "Find all unclosed issue(Backlog, Todo, In progress) in all projects and close them" was not fully met due to the premature halt in the issue closing iteration caused by the URL issue and the subsequent unaddressed issues.

Based on analyzing the current Subtask, its goal, and **your Subtask's execution trajectory**, the Check Agent reports that the current Subtask has failed to complete. The above is the Check Agent's check report.
Please combine this check report with the current Subtask's historical execution trajectory to analyze the key obstacles currently hindering task completion and develop an actionable plan for the next steps.


205. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================
* The current Subtask still has the following issues:
    1. The issue closing process was incomplete, failing to close all identified unclosed issues across all projects.
    2. The URLs extracted for individual issues during the collection phase (SubTask4) were sometimes malformed or incomplete, preventing direct navigation to the issue details page for status updates. For example, `OPENH-4`'s extracted URL was incorrect.
    3. The previous implementation lacked robust error handling and continuation mechanisms, leading to a halt in processing when an issue (like `OPENH-4`) could not be accessed, rather than attempting to close remaining issues.

* Consider trying the following actions:
    1. Iterate through each `issue` in the `all_unclosed_issues` list.
    2. For each issue, use its `project_name` to look up the correct base `issues_url` (containing the project UUID) from the `projects_list`.
    3. Navigate the browser to this project-specific issues overview page (`browser_go_to_url`).
    4. Wait for the page to load and get updated elements (`browser_wait_and_get_update`).
    5. On the project's issues overview page, identify the specific link element corresponding to the current issue being processed (using `issue_id` as the primary identifier).
    6. Click on this issue link (`browser_click`) to navigate to the issue's detailed view. This ensures the correct, full URL for the issue is loaded.
    7. Wait for the issue detail page to load (`browser_wait_and_get_update`).
    8. Locate the status dropdown element on the issue detail page (e.g., a button with text "Backlog", "Todo", or "In Progress").
    9. Click this status dropdown (`browser_click`) to open the status options.
    10. Wait for the options to appear (`browser_wait_and_get_update`).
    11. Identify and click the "Done" option within the opened dropdown (`browser_click`).
    12. Wait for the status update to register and page to refresh (`browser_wait_and_get_update`).
    13. Verify that the issue's status has indeed changed to "Done" by examining the `webpage accessibility tree`.
    14. Implement error handling (e.g., `try-except` blocks) for each step of this process, allowing the loop to continue to the next issue even if a specific issue cannot be updated. Log any failures for post-task review.
