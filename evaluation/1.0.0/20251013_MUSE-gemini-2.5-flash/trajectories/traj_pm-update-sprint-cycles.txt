# ACTION #
During task execution, you can perform **Actions**, including:
1. **Tool Call**
2. **Python Code Execution**

## Action Output Format
1. **Tool Call**
When calling a tool, please output:
<tool_call>
{"name": "<function-name>", "arguments": <args-json-object>}
</tool_call>
- `<function-name>`: Tool function name
- `<args-json-object>`: Call arguments (JSON format)

Complex shell features like command chaining (`&&`, `||`), pipes (`|`), I/O redirection (`>`, `>>`), and backgrounding (`&`) are often *not reliably interpreted by `run_cmd` directly* and can lead to unexpected behavior or errors (e.g., `SyntaxError`, `command not found`). For any non-trivial shell interaction or complex logic, *always prefer consolidating operations into a single Python script that uses `subprocess` for explicit control and robustness* over multiple `run_cmd` calls or complex shell syntax.** 3) Quote arguments containing spaces (`\"path with spaces\"`). 4) State changes (`cd`) do not persist across calls.", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"command": {"type": "string", "description": "shell command string."}}, "required": ["command"]}}}
</tools>

2. **Python Code Execution**
When executing Python code, please output:
<code>
... your code ...
</code>
- The working directory is `/workspace`
- Executing dangerous, destructive, or time-consuming code is prohibited.
- If both a **Tool Call** and **Python Code Execution** are included in the output, the tool call takes precedence, and the Python code will not be executed.
- Using outdated or limited python libraries may result in incomplete or inaccurate observations (e.g. missing images from PDFs or failing to extract key content). Always prefer robust, modern libraries to ensure full and reliable results.
- When performing file conversion or data extraction, always ensure **data integrity**. Verify that the structure, content, and critical fields of the source file are preserved in the output. Check row and column counts, headers, and key values before and after processing. **Avoid silent loss**, truncation, or unintended alteration of data.

## Action Execution Result Processing
- After each action is executed, an Observation is returned, which includes:
    1. `<tool_response>`: The result of the tool or code execution.
    2. `<tool_instruction>`: The instruction associated with a specific action, used to guide the next step or restrict subsequent behavior.
- **Note**: Do not fabricate observations.

## Security and Restrictions
- **Coding Actions (such as Python, CMD, etc.)**
    - Do not run high-risk operations that are large in code size or take a long time.
    - Do not execute code that could cause data loss, system damage, or irreversible changes.
    - Do not use the kill command with wildcards like * or other dangerous parameters that could result in a wide range of matches.
    - Prefer using the Python interpreter to execute code (safer and more efficient) rather than using the CMD tool.

> ⚠️ **Important**
> When your output contains content that fully conforms to the **Tool Call** or **Python Code Execution** format, the system will immediately parse, identify, and execute it as an **Action** without further confirmation and without reversal.
> Therefore, before outputting, always confirm that this is your **intended** action and fully assess the potential consequences and risks.
> If you are only using **quotes, demonstrations, or examples**, be sure to break the formatting or escape it to prevent the system from interpreting it as a real action.

# OBJECTIVE #
Your core objective is to independently and efficiently complete the tasks assigned to you by the company.


# MEMORY #
During previous tasks, you have accumulated the following reusable knowledge:

## Resolution Patterns
Comprehensive Contextualization: Systematically acquire and aggregate information from diverse, potentially unstructured sources, prioritizing local processing and cross-validation, to ensure a complete, coherent operational view and inform robust decisions.
Robust External Interaction: Prioritize stable, predictable interaction methods, such as structured APIs, and dynamically adapt strategies to ensure continuity and reliability with external systems despite their inconsistencies or volatility.
Adaptive Constraint Handling: When an objective is blocked by an unresolvable external constraint, acknowledge the limitation, perform necessary cleanup of partial artifacts, and adapt the strategy to proceed with viable data, avoiding unproductive retries.
Modular Resilient Design: Decompose operations into modular, decoupled units with explicit state management, to enhance predictability, isolate errors, improve maintainability, and ensure operational continuity.
Progressive Verification: Implement multi-stage validation, from granular checks within pipelines to comprehensive outcome validation, to localize errors, confirm system states, and ensure successful execution.

## Platform/Application Operation Guides

> This directory provides a comprehensive index of guides, compiling best practices and experience summaries for accomplishing various tasks.

### Recommended Usage Process
1. **Review the Guide First**  
   Before starting a task, browse the relevant entries in the directory to identify potentially useful guidance.  
2. **Targeted Access**  
   Use the `access_the_application_guide` tool to view detailed steps if necessary.  
3. **Reuse with Flexibility**  
   Apply past successful steps when they fit the current situation, but stay aware of possible mismatches.  
4. **Explore When Deviations Arise**  
   If the environment or results diverge from the guide, stop rigidly following it and explore alternative approaches through small, safe, and adaptive steps.

### Value of Guides
- Reduce task completion time by leveraging accumulated experience.  
- Lower error rates and avoid common pitfalls.  
- Ensure consistent, professional execution of tasks.  

### Guide Reliability & Adaptation
- Guides may be outdated, biased, or contain errors — they are “historical experience,” not absolute truth.  
- Use guides as starting points, not as strict rules.  
- When deviations or conflicts appear, **exit the guide and explore new paths** instead of persisting.  
- Record useful deviation points for later improvement of the guides.

</Login>
</Application>
</tool_response>
<tool_instruction>
After accessing, carefully read the guide content. Extract and adapt relevant steps, recognizing that guide information may be outdated or require UI verification. Always prioritize current browser state by performing `browser_wait_and_get_update()` immediately before attempting to follow guide steps.
</tool_instruction>

07. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================
Thought: I have accessed the login guide for Plane. The guide outlines the steps to log in, which include navigating to the URL, entering the email and password, and clicking the appropriate buttons. I will now proceed with the first step: navigating to the Plane URL and then updating the browser state to identify interactive elements.
Action:
<tool_call>
{"name": "browser_go_to_url", "arguments": {"url": "http://the-agent-company.com:8091/"}}
</tool_call>
08. | ================================================== USER MESSAGE ==================================================
Observation: 
<tool_response>
Performed browser action: 🔗 Navigated to http://the-agent-company.com:8091/
The updated browser page status is as follows:
<webpage accessibility tree>[SYSTEM INFO: History accessibility tree removed for brevity]</webpage accessibility tree>
<webpage interactive elements>[SYSTEM INFO: History interactive elements removed for brevity]</webpage interactive elements>

</tool_response>
<tool_instruction>
Always inspect the `webpage accessibility tree` and `webpage interactive elements` after navigation to confirm the page loaded as expected. This step is crucial for verifying successful navigation and for preparing for subsequent interactions by ensuring the browser state is as anticipated.
</tool_instruction>

09. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================
Thought: I have successfully navigated to the Plane login page. The next step is to input the email address. Based on the `webpage interactive elements`, the email input field has index `3`. I will use the email `agent@company.com` as per the account information.
Action:
<tool_call>
{"name": "browser_input_text", "arguments": {"index": 3, "text": "agent@company.com"}}
</tool_call>
10. | ================================================== USER MESSAGE ==================================================
Observation: 
<tool_response>
Performed browser action: ⌨️  Input agent@company.com into index 3
The updated browser page status is as follows:
<webpage accessibility tree>[SYSTEM INFO: History accessibility tree removed for brevity]</webpage accessibility tree>
<webpage interactive elements>[SYSTEM INFO: History interactive elements removed for brevity]</webpage interactive elements>

</tool_response>
<tool_instruction>
After inputting text, always use `browser_wait_and_get_update` to verify the text input, check for immediate validation feedback, or confirm any UI changes (e.g., enable/disable buttons, form submission readiness). Be especially mindful of index volatility, as UI changes can rapidly invalidate previously retrieved indices.
</tool_instruction>

11. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================
Action:
<tool_call>
{"name": "browser_click", "arguments": {"index": 4}}
</tool_call>
12. | ================================================== USER MESSAGE ==================================================
Observation: 
<tool_response>
Performed browser action: Clicked button with index 4: Continue
The updated browser page status is as follows:
<webpage accessibility tree>[SYSTEM INFO: History accessibility tree removed for brevity]</webpage accessibility tree>
<webpage interactive elements>[SYSTEM INFO: History interactive elements removed for brevity]</webpage interactive elements>

</tool_response>
<tool_instruction>
If an `Element index does not exist` error is returned, it indicates extreme element volatility. **Always re-evaluate `webpage interactive elements` with `browser_wait_and_get_update` immediately before attempting a click, and crucially, confirm the element's `text` or `aria-label` attribute semantically matches the intended target.** If direct clicking by index proves unreliable, *especially within dynamic lists or sidebars (e.g., chat contact lists)*, consider alternative strategies like using an application's built-in search functionality or `browser_go_to_url` if a direct link is known, rather than repeatedly retrying. For form submissions or general action triggers, `browser_send_keys` with 'Enter' is a more robust alternative and **highly recommended for reliability**.

Thought: I have accessed the guides for `IdentifyNextLogicalSprint`, `IdentifyAndCollectIssues`, and `ExtractIssueDetailsFromList`.

The `IdentifyAndCollectIssues` guide seems most relevant for the current subtask, as it describes how to extract a list of issues with specific details. It suggests using `browser_extract_content_by_vision` as a first pass, then cross-verifying with the `webpage accessibility tree` for critical fields like 'Assignee'.

I am currently on the 'Cycles' page. To identify issues, I need to navigate to the "Current Sprint" or "Active Sprint" details page. I need to find the active sprint first.

Looking at the `webpage interactive elements` from the previous observation (which was after navigating to the cycles page), I see:
- `link "Sprint 1"` at index 14
- `link "Sprint 2"` at index 17
- `link "Sprint 3"` at index 20

I need to determine which one is the "current" or "active" sprint. Usually, the active sprint is clearly marked or is the one currently in progress. I will use `browser_extract_content_by_vision` to identify the active sprint.

- `link '0% Sprint 1'` at index 37, which is under "Active cycle".
- `link '0% Sprint 2'` at index 78, which is under "Upcoming cycle 1".

This indicates that "Sprint 1" is the active cycle. The visual model likely truncated "Sprint 1" to "Spri". The full name is "Sprint 1", and its URL is `http://the-agent-company.com:8091/tac/projects/ea796314-eeec-41aa-816d-58be13909bf2/cycles/a0bc3e73-d4cc-4d54-981d-2c4ab73a0e0c`.

Thought: I have successfully navigated to the "Sprint 1" details page, which is the active sprint. I have identified all issues within this sprint that are "To Do" or "In Progress" (no "Backlog" issues were found). For each issue, I have extracted its ID, title, and assignee.

The identified unfinished issues are:
- Issue ID: RISIN-11, Title: Decrease database latency, Status: In Progress, Assignee: liu.qiang
- Issue ID: RISIN-10, Title: Evaluate data throughput, Status: In Progress, Assignee: zhang.wei
- Issue ID: RISIN-7, Title: Conduct memory usage analysis, Status: Todo, Assignee: liu.qiang
- Issue ID: RISIN-5, Title: Identify necessary operators and requirements, Status: In Progress, Assignee: zhang.wei

This completes the subtask of identifying unfinished issues in the current sprint.
Final Answer: The identified unfinished issues in the current sprint are:
[
    {"issue_id": "RISIN-11", "title": "Decrease database latency", "status": "In Progress", "assignee": "liu.qiang"},
    {"issue_id": "RISIN-10", "title": "Evaluate data throughput", "status": "In Progress", "assignee": "zhang.wei"},

Title: Subtask 3 Completion Verification Report - Identify Unfinished Issues in Current Sprint

Checklist Details:
- **Verify Current Page URL and Title**: The Task Agent successfully navigated to the correct 'Sprint 1' page. As confirmed by `Observation 07`, the URL is `http://the-agent-company.com:8091/tac/projects/ea796314-eeec-41aa-816d-58be13909bf2/cycles/a0bc3e73-d4cc-4d54-981d-2c4ab73a0e0c/` and the page title is 'RisingWave - Sprint 1', matching the intended target.
- **Extract Issues from Accessibility Tree**: The Task Agent accurately extracted the issue details. Manual extraction from the `webpage accessibility tree` in `Observation 07` confirms the following issues and their details, which perfectly match the Task Agent's output in `Observation 08`:
    - Issue ID: RISIN-11, Title: Decrease database latency, Status: In Progress, Assignee: liu.qiang
    - Issue ID: RISIN-10, Title: Evaluate data throughput, Status: In Progress, Assignee: zhang.wei
    - Issue ID: RISIN-7, Title: Conduct memory usage analysis, Status: Todo, Assignee: liu.qiang
    - Issue ID: RISIN-5, Title: Identify necessary operators and requirements, Status: In Progress, Assignee: zhang.wei

SubTask4: Identify Next Sprint
Goal: Determine the name or identifier of the upcoming sprint cycle in the 'RisingWave' project.
51. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================
Thought: I need to identify the next sprint. I have already accessed the `IdentifyNextLogicalSprint` guide in the previous subtask preparation. I will use the information from that guide to determine the next sprint. I am currently on the "Sprint 1" details page. I need to go back to the "Cycles" overview page to identify the next sprint.

The `IdentifyNextLogicalSprint` guide suggests:
"Identify the interactive element (button) representing the current sprint for the target issue (e.g., `button 'Sprint 1'`, `button 'No cycle'`) -> browser_click(index=<current_sprint_button_index>) to open the sprint dropdown -> browser_wait_and_get_update() to refresh elements and capture dropdown options -> Analyze the `webpage accessibility tree` and `webpage interactive elements` to identify the `listitem` options corresponding to the available sprints (e.g., 'No cycle', 'Sprint 1', 'Sprint 2') -> Based on the current sprint (e.g., 'Sprint 1') and the identified available sprint options (e.g., 'Sprint 2'), logically determine the name of the 'next' sprint."

Since I am already on the sprint details page, I will first navigate back to the main cycles page to get an overview of all sprints.

Thought: I have clicked on the link for "Decrease database latency" (RISIN-11). However, the page did not navigate to the issue details page as expected. Instead, the `webpage accessibility tree` and `webpage interactive elements` show that I am still on the "Sprint 1" page, and the issue details are displayed as an overlay or a side panel. This is a common UI pattern where clicking an item in a list opens its details without changing the main URL.

Now I need to find the "Cycle" field within this overlay/side panel to change it from "Sprint 1" to "Sprint 2".

Title: Subtask 5 Completion Verification Report - Move Unfinished Issues to Next Sprint

Checklist Details:
- **Verify Issues in Sprint 2**: All four issues identified as unfinished in Sprint 1 (RISIN-11, RISIN-10, RISIN-7, RISIN-5) were found to be present in 'Sprint 2' after navigation to `http://the-agent-company.com:8091/tac/projects/ea796314-eeec-41aa-816d-58be13909bf2/cycles/47d00cb0-096b-4184-be07-1639689601ac/` (as confirmed by the `webpage accessibility tree` in the observation of CheckStep:CheckSprint2Content). This verifies that the issues have been successfully moved to Sprint 2.
- **Verify Absence from Sprint 1**: After navigating back to the 'Sprint 1' page at `http://the-agent-company.com:8091/tac/projects/ea796314-eeec-41aa-816d-58be13909bf2/cycles/a0bc3e73-d4cc-4d54-981d-2c4ab73a0e0c/`, the `webpage accessibility tree` showed "No issues added to the cycle" and the issue count displayed "0 Issue" (as confirmed in the observation of CheckStep:CheckSprint1Content). This confirms that the issues were successfully removed from Sprint 1.
- **Verify Collected Data for Notification**: The `moved_issues_for_notification` list compiled by the Task Agent in Observation 38 accurately reflects the issue ID, title, and assignee for each of the four moved issues, matching the data extracted in Subtask 3's check report (as confirmed in CheckStep:CheckCollectedData).

Conclusion:
The Subtask "Move Unfinished Issues to Next Sprint" is **complete**. The Task Agent successfully moved all specified issues from Sprint 1 to Sprint 2 and correctly collected their details for subsequent notification.

Title: Subtask 6 Completion Verification Report - Login to Rocket.Chat

Checklist Details:
- **Verify Current URL and Page Title**: As confirmed by `Observation 11`, the browser's current URL is `http://the-agent-company.com:3000/home` and the page title is `Rocket.Chat`. This aligns with the expected state after successfully logging into Rocket.Chat.
- **Absence of Login Form Elements**: By examining the `webpage interactive elements` in `Observation 11`, it is clear that the login form elements (username input field, password input field, and "Login" button) are no longer present. This indicates a successful transition away from the login interface.
- **Presence of Rocket.Chat Dashboard Elements**: The `webpage accessibility tree` in `Observation 11` explicitly shows key Rocket.Chat dashboard components. These include navigation buttons such as `button 'Home'`, `button 'Search'`, `button 'Directory'`, `button 'Display'`, `button 'Create new'`, and `button 'Administration'`. Additionally, channel lists like `link 'general'`, `link 'kudos'`, `link 'mike_chen'`, and `link 'chen_xinyi'` are visible. The presence of these elements confirms that the user interface has loaded the Rocket.Chat dashboard, signifying a successful login.

Conclusion:
The Subtask "Login to Rocket.Chat" is **complete**. The Task Agent successfully navigated to the Rocket.Chat application, entered the correct credentials, and the subsequent browser state confirms a successful login by displaying the Rocket.Chat dashboard elements and the absence of login form elements.

The message input field should also appear cleared after successful sending. For replies, allow additional time for `browser_wait_and_get_update()` (e.g., 5-10 seconds) then analyze `webpage accessibility tree`."}

Please comprehensively review the entire task execution process, including all subtasks and the contextual information collected.  
Cross-check carefully against the overall task requirements:

1. **Completeness Check**: Ensure every aspect of the requirements has been addressed. Confirm that no items were skipped, postponed, or only partially completed.  
2. **Consistency Check**: Verify that all intermediate results are logically coherent and data-wise consistent with the final conclusions. There should be no contradictions, missing steps, or unexplained gaps.  
3. **Final Completion Confirmation**:  
   - If any requirements remain unfinished or results are insufficient, explicitly list the next subtasks to resolve them.  
   - If all requirements are fully and correctly met, return an empty task plan to indicate the task is completely finished.
