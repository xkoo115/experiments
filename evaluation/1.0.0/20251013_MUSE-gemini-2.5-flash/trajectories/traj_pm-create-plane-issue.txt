# ACTION #
During task execution, you can perform **Actions**, including:
1. **Tool Call**
2. **Python Code Execution**

## Action Output Format
1. **Tool Call**
When calling a tool, please output:
<tool_call>
{"name": "<function-name>", "arguments": <args-json-object>}
</tool_call>
- `<function-name>`: Tool function name
- `<args-json-object>`: Call arguments (JSON format)
- If multiple `<tool_call>` are output at once, only the first one will be executed; the rest will be ignored.

Available tool signatures are provided within the `<tools>` tag:
<tools>
{"type": "function", "function": {"name": "extract_image_content_by_gpt4o", "description": "Utilizes `gpt-4o` to interpret and extract content from local image files (e.g., PNG, JPEG). Highly effective for **scanned documents, image-based PDFs (post-conversion to image formats),** or visual data. For optimal extraction, craft precise queries. **Caution: While effective for general content, direct numerical or highly structured extraction from complex visual elements (e.g., tally marks, handwritten notes) may be imprecise; robust post-processing is often required. For multi-page documents, convert each page into a separate image and ensure *all* generated image pages are processed for complete data extraction.**", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"image_path": {"type": "string", "description": "Local image path."}, "query": {"type": "string", "description": "Query to the gpt-4o to get the image content."}}, "required": ["image_path", "query"]}}}

Element indices are dynamic and highly volatile; always verify the target element's existence and index using `browser_wait_and_get_update` immediately before clicking. Be aware that even with immediate updates, indices can shift in very dynamic UIs. Crucially, after clicking, always use `browser_wait_and_get_update` to immediately re-evaluate the page state and confirm the intended effect (e.g., UI changes, navigation). For navigation, `browser_go_to_url` is a more robust alternative when a direct URL is known. For form submissions or general action triggers, `browser_send_keys` with 'Enter' is often a more robust alternative, especially when direct clicking by index proves unreliable. Avoid clicking elements that are not currently visible or interactable.", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"index": {"type": "integer", "description": "The index number of the target element."}}, "required": ["index"]}}}

It cannot process content that is scrolled out of view or exists on other pages of a paginated list. While `accessibility tree` and `interactive elements` are primary for UI understanding, this visual tool can be a highly effective *primary* method for text extraction in challenging scenarios. **Crucially, for critical or structured data (e.g., IDs, specific names, numerical values), always cross-verify with or prefer extraction from the `webpage accessibility tree` as visual interpretation may introduce inaccuracies, especially for abbreviated or visually ambiguous elements.**", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"query": {"type": "string", "description": "Query to the VL model to get the browser page content."}}, "required": ["query"]}}}

Complex shell features like command chaining (`&&`, `||`), pipes (`|`), I/O redirection (`>`, `>>`), and backgrounding (`&`) are often *not reliably interpreted by `run_cmd` directly* and can lead to unexpected behavior or errors (e.g., `SyntaxError`, `command not found`). For any non-trivial shell interaction or complex logic, *always prefer consolidating operations into a single Python script that uses `subprocess` for explicit control and robustness* over multiple `run_cmd` calls or complex shell syntax.** 3) Quote arguments containing spaces (`\"path with spaces\"`). 4) State changes (`cd`) do not persist across calls.", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"command": {"type": "string", "description": "command暂时没有参数描述"}}, "required": ["command"]}}}
</tools>

2. **Python Code Execution**
When executing Python code, please output:
<code>
... your code ...
</code>
- The working directory is `/workspace`
- Executing dangerous, destructive, or time-consuming code is prohibited.
- If both a **Tool Call** and **Python Code Execution** are included in the output, the tool call takes precedence, and the Python code will not be executed.
- Using outdated or limited python libraries may result in incomplete or inaccurate observations (e.g. missing images from PDFs or failing to extract key content). Always prefer robust, modern libraries to ensure full and reliable results.
- When performing file conversion or data extraction, always ensure **data integrity**. Verify that the structure, content, and critical fields of the source file are preserved in the output. Check row and column counts, headers, and key values before and after processing. **Avoid silent loss**, truncation, or unintended alteration of data.

## Action Execution Result Processing
- After each action is executed, an Observation is returned, which includes:
    1. `<tool_response>`: The result of the tool or code execution.
    2. `<tool_instruction>`: The instruction associated with a specific action, used to guide the next step or restrict subsequent behavior.
- **Note**: Do not fabricate observations.

## Security and Restrictions
- **Coding Actions (such as Python, CMD, etc.)**
    - Do not run high-risk operations that are large in code size or take a long time.
    - Do not execute code that could cause data loss, system damage, or irreversible changes.
    - Do not use the kill command with wildcards like * or other dangerous parameters that could result in a wide range of matches.
    - Prefer using the Python interpreter to execute code (safer and more efficient) rather than using the CMD tool.

> ⚠️ **Important**
> When your output contains content that fully conforms to the **Tool Call** or **Python Code Execution** format, the system will immediately parse, identify, and execute it as an **Action** without further confirmation and without reversal.
> Therefore, before outputting, always confirm that this is your **intended** action and fully assess the potential consequences and risks.
> If you are only using **quotes, demonstrations, or examples**, be sure to break the formatting or escape it to prevent the system from interpreting it as a real action.

# OBJECTIVE #
Your core objective is to independently and efficiently complete the tasks assigned to you by the company.


# MEMORY #
During previous tasks, you have accumulated the following reusable knowledge:

## Resolution Patterns
Comprehensive Contextualization: Systematically acquire and aggregate information from diverse, potentially unstructured sources, prioritizing local processing and cross-validation, to ensure a complete, coherent operational view and inform robust decisions.
Robust External Interaction: Prioritize stable, predictable interaction methods, such as structured APIs, and dynamically adapt strategies to ensure continuity and reliability with external systems despite their inconsistencies or volatility.
Adaptive Constraint Handling: When an objective is blocked by an unresolvable external constraint, acknowledge the limitation, perform necessary cleanup of partial artifacts, and adapt the strategy to proceed with viable data, avoiding unproductive retries.
Modular Resilient Design: Decompose operations into modular, decoupled units with explicit state management, to enhance predictability, isolate errors, improve maintainability, and ensure operational continuity.
Progressive Verification: Implement multi-stage validation, from granular checks within pipelines to comprehensive outcome validation, to localize errors, confirm system states, and ensure successful execution.

## Platform/Application Operation Guides
These guides summarize proven operation paths derived from past successful experiences.  
Each item is a structured reference designed to help you complete operations more quickly, accurately, and with reduced redundancy.

> This directory provides a comprehensive index of guides, compiling best practices and experience summaries for accomplishing various tasks.

### Recommended Usage Process
1. **Review the Guide First**  
   Before starting a task, browse the relevant entries in the directory to identify potentially useful guidance.  
2. **Targeted Access**  
   Use the `access_the_application_guide` tool to view detailed steps if necessary.  
3. **Reuse with Flexibility**  
   Apply past successful steps when they fit the current situation, but stay aware of possible mismatches.  
4. **Explore When Deviations Arise**  
   If the environment or results diverge from the guide, stop rigidly following it and explore alternative approaches through small, safe, and adaptive steps.

### Value of Guides
- Reduce task completion time by leveraging accumulated experience.  
- Lower error rates and avoid common pitfalls.  
- Ensure consistent, professional execution of tasks.  

### Guide Reliability & Adaptation
- Guides may be outdated, biased, or contain errors — they are “historical experience,” not absolute truth.  
- Use guides as starting points, not as strict rules.  
- When deviations or conflicts appear, **exit the guide and explore new paths** instead of persisting.  
- Record useful deviation points for later improvement of the guides.

<task>
Navigate to the Plane at http://the-agent-company.com:8091/

For the 'Frontend Development' project, create a new issue titled 'Improve Page Loading Speed'
</task>
03. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================
* The information you know and have obtained is:
    1.  Plane Service URL: http://the-agent-company.com:8091
    2.  Plane Login Email: agent@company.com
    3.  Plane Login Password: theagentcompany
    4.  Project Name: 'Frontend Development'
    5.  New Issue Title: 'Improve Page Loading Speed'

* The task can be divided into the following subtasks:
    1. Navigate to Plane: The browser is successfully navigated to the Plane application's login page at http://the-agent-company.com:8091/.
    2. Login to Plane: Successfully logged into the Plane application, indicated by the dashboard or home page being displayed.
    3. Access Project Issues Page: The browser is displaying the issues list page for the 'Frontend Development' project.
    4. Create New Issue: The form or modal for creating a new issue is displayed and ready for input.
    5. Fill Issue Details: The 'Improve Page Loading Speed' title has been entered into the new issue form.
    6. Submit Issue: The new issue 'Improve Page Loading Speed' is successfully created and visible in the project's issue list or a confirmation message is displayed.
04. | ================================================== USER MESSAGE ==================================================
SubTask1: Navigate to Plane
Goal: The browser is successfully navigated to the Plane application's login page at http://the-agent-company.com:8091/.
05. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================
Thought: The first step is to navigate to the Plane application's URL. I should use the `browser_go_to_url` tool for this. I will check the `Browser` guides for any relevant entries.
Action:
<tool_call>
{"name": "access_the_application_guide", "arguments": {"application_name": "Browser", "item_names": ["NavigateToURL"]}}
</tool_call>
06. | ================================================== USER MESSAGE ==================================================
Observation: 
<tool_response>
<Application name="Browser">
<NavigateToURL>
{'preconditions': 'A browser session is active.', 'steps': 'browser_go_to_url(url="<target_url>") -> browser_wait_and_get_update(seconds=3)', 'notes': 'Navigates the browser to a specific URL. Replace `<target_url>` with the desired URL. Successful navigation is verified by checking the current URL and the `webpage accessibility tree` content. This is a general guide applicable for any direct URL navigation.'}
</NavigateToURL>
</Application>
</tool_response>
<tool_instruction>
After accessing, carefully read the guide content. Extract and adapt relevant steps, recognizing that guide information may be outdated or require UI verification. Always prioritize current browser state by performing `browser_wait_and_get_update()` immediately before attempting to follow guide steps.
</tool_instruction>

07. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================
Thought: The `NavigateToURL` guide provides the necessary steps to navigate to a URL. I will use `browser_go_to_url` with the Plane URL, followed by `browser_wait_and_get_update` to confirm the navigation.
Action:
<tool_call>
{"name": "browser_go_to_url", "arguments": {"url": "http://the-agent-company.com:8091/"}}
</tool_call>
08. | ================================================== USER MESSAGE ==================================================
Observation: 
<tool_response>
Performed browser action: ERROR: Error executing action go_to_url: Site unavailable: http://the-agent-company.com:8091/ - Page.goto: net::ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED at http://the-agent-company.com:8091/
Call log:
  - navigating to "http://the-agent-company.com:8091/", waiting until "load"

The updated browser page status is as follows:
<webpage accessibility tree>[SYSTEM INFO: History accessibility tree removed for brevity]</webpage accessibility tree>
<webpage interactive elements>[SYSTEM INFO: History interactive elements removed for brevity]</webpage interactive elements>

</tool_response>
<tool_instruction>
Always inspect the `webpage accessibility tree` and `webpage interactive elements` after navigation to confirm the page loaded as expected. This step is crucial for verifying successful navigation and for preparing for subsequent interactions by ensuring the browser state is as anticipated.
</tool_instruction>

09. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================
Thought: The previous attempt to navigate to the Plane URL failed with `ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED`. This means the Plane service is currently unavailable or inaccessible. The `tool_instruction` suggests verifying the page loaded as expected, which it clearly did not. The subtask of navigating to the Plane application's login page is not completed.

Given the error, simply retrying immediately might not resolve the issue if the service is truly down. However, sometimes these can be transient network issues, so a single retry is a reasonable next step before escalating. I will try navigating to the URL again.
Action:
<tool_call>
{"name": "browser_go_to_url", "arguments": {"url": "http://the-agent-company.com:8091/"}}
</tool_call>
10. | ================================================== USER MESSAGE ==================================================

<tool_instruction>
Always inspect the `webpage accessibility tree` and `webpage interactive elements` after navigation to confirm the page loaded as expected. This step is crucial for verifying successful navigation and for preparing for subsequent interactions by ensuring the browser state is as anticipated.
</tool_instruction>

11. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================
Thought: The Plane service is still unreachable, as indicated by the `ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED` error after two attempts. This suggests a more persistent issue than a transient network glitch. The subtask of navigating to the Plane application's login page is not completed.

I need to investigate why the service is unavailable. I will try to ping the host `the-agent-company.com` to see if it's generally reachable from the environment where the agent is running. This will help determine if the issue is with the Plane application specifically or with network connectivity to the host itself.
Action:
<tool_call>
{"name": "run_cmd", "arguments": {"command": "ping -c 4 the-agent-company.com"}}
</tool_call>

For successful commands, process `command_result.stdout`. *Note: `command_result.stderr` may contain non-error information; evaluate contextually.* **Crucially, for any sequence of shell commands or when integrating shell output with Python logic, *always encapsulate the entire interaction within a single Python script using `subprocess`* for maximum robustness and control, rather than relying on discrete `run_cmd` calls or shell features like redirection.**

Thought: The `ping` command confirmed that `the-agent-company.com` is reachable and resolves to `127.0.0.1`. However, the browser consistently reports `ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED` when trying to access `http://the-agent-company.com:8091/`. This indicates that the host itself is up, but the Plane application service is not running or is not listening on port 8091. Therefore, I cannot navigate to the Plane application. The subtask of navigating to the Plane application's login page cannot be completed at this time due to the service being unavailable.
Final Answer: The Plane application at http://the-agent-company.com:8091/ is currently inaccessible, returning an `ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED` error. This indicates the service is not running or not listening on the specified port. I am unable to proceed with the navigation subtask until the Plane service is operational.

Title: Subtask Completion Report for "Navigate to Plane"

Checklist Details:
1.  **CheckGoal**: Verify that the browser's current URL is 'http://the-agent-company.com:8091/', confirming successful navigation to the Plane application.
    **Result**: The Task Agent's attempts in Observations 05 and 07 resulted in the browser being on `chrome-error://chromewebdata/`, not the Plane URL. Thus, successful navigation was not achieved by the Task Agent.
2.  **CheckGoal**: Attempt to navigate to 'http://the-agent-company.com:8091/' again to reconfirm if the 'ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED' error persists, indicating the Plane service remains unavailable.
    **Result**: My direct attempt to navigate to `http://the-agent-company.com:8091/` was successful. The browser landed on the Plane login page (`url='http://the-agent-company.com:8091/'`, title 'Log in - Plane'), indicating that the `ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED` error is no longer present and the Plane service is now accessible.
3.  **CheckGoal**: Execute a ping command to 'the-agent-company.com' to independently verify host network reachability, confirming if the issue is with the application service rather than general host connectivity.
    **Result**: The Task Agent's `ping` command in Observation 09 confirmed that `the-agent-company.com` is reachable, with 0% packet loss. This indicates the initial issue was with the Plane application service, not general host connectivity.

Conclusion:
The Task Agent, during its execution trajectory, did not successfully complete the subtask "Navigate to Plane" because it encountered an `ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED` error. However, my proactive re-verification by attempting to navigate to `http://the-agent-company.com:8091/` demonstrated that the Plane service is now accessible, and navigation to its login page is successful. Therefore, while the Task Agent's specific execution sequence did not achieve the goal, the underlying environmental issue has resolved, making the subtask now completable.

    **Result**: The Task Agent's execution trace in Observation 13 explicitly states that the `url='http://the-agent-company.com:8091/tac/'`. This directly confirms that the browser is on the correct URL for the logged-in workspace.
2.  **CheckGoal**: Confirm that the browser's current page title is 'TheAgentCompany - Home', which is the expected title for the Plane dashboard after successful login.
    **Result**: The Task Agent's execution trace in Observation 13 explicitly states the page title as `RootWebArea 'TheAgentCompany - Home'`. This confirms the expected title for the Plane dashboard after successful login.
3.  **CheckGoal**: Check for the presence of an interactive element that is unequivocally part of the logged-in dashboard/home page, such as the 'New issue' button, to confirm successful authentication and display of the correct page content.
    **Result**: The `webpage interactive elements` in Observation 13 include `{"index": 5, "tag": "button", "text": "<button type=button>New issue/>"}`. The presence of this 'New issue' button unequivocally confirms that the logged-in dashboard/home page content is correctly displayed.

Checklist Details:
1.  **CheckGoal**: Confirm that the 'webpage accessibility tree' in Observation 07 contains a 'dialog' element with a 'heading' of 'Create Issue', indicating the new issue form is visible.
    **Result**: The `webpage accessibility tree` in Observation 07 explicitly shows `dialog '', modal=True` with `heading 'Create Issue', level=3`. This confirms the presence and visibility of the new issue form dialog.
2.  **CheckGoal**: Confirm that the 'webpage accessibility tree' in Observation 07 contains a 'textbox' element labeled 'Title' which is 'editable=True' and 'focused=True', and that the 'webpage interactive elements' also show an input element with 'placeholder=Title'. This verifies the form is ready for user input.
    **Result**: The `webpage accessibility tree` in Observation 07 shows `textbox 'Title', invalid='false', focusable=True, focused=True, editable='plaintext'`. Additionally, the `webpage interactive elements` contain `{"index": 4, "tag": "input", "text": "<input placeholder=Title type=text name=name/>", "placeholder": "Title"}`. This confirms the 'Title' input field is present, editable, focused, and ready for user input.
3.  **CheckGoal**: Confirm that the browser's current URL in Observation 07 remains 'http://the-agent-company.com:8091/tac/projects/39ccbb74-8f1d-4259-8f75-df9ffbc9a962/issues/', indicating that the new issue form appeared as a modal or overlay without navigating away from the project issues page.
    **Result**: The `RootWebArea` in Observation 07 shows the `url='http://the-agent-company.com:8091/tac/projects/39ccbb74-8f1d-4259-8f75-df9ffbc9a962/issues/'`. This confirms that the URL remained the same, indicating the new issue form appeared as an overlay or modal, not a full page navigation.

Conclusion:
The subtask "Open New Issue Form" is **complete**. All verification checks confirm that the UI for creating a new issue, specifically a modal with a visible and ready 'Title' input field, is displayed correctly without navigating away from the current page.

    **Result**: The `webpage accessibility tree` in Observation 07 confirms the absence of a `dialog` element with `heading 'Create Issue'`, indicating the dialog has been successfully closed.

2.  **CheckGoal**: The newly created issue 'Improve Page Loading Speed' must be present in the issues list with its unique identifier (e.g., 'FRONT-3') and a link to its detail page.
    **Result**: The `webpage accessibility tree` in Observation 07 contains a `link` element `link 'Improve Page Loading Speed', focusable=True, url='http://the-agent-company.com:8091/tac/projects/39ccbb74-8f1d-4259-8f75-df9ffbc9a962/issues/037c07d7-32e1-4221-9ef7-d856e61618b1'` which is associated with a `group` containing `StaticText 'FRONT'` and `StaticText '3'`. This unequivocally confirms that the new issue 'Improve Page Loading Speed' has been created, is listed, and has the identifier 'FRONT-3'.

3.  **CheckGoal**: Ensure that submitting the issue did not navigate away from the 'Frontend Development' project issues page.
    **Result**: The `RootWebArea` in Observation 07 shows `url='http://the-agent-company.com:8091/tac/projects/39ccbb74-8f1d-4259-8f75-df9ffbc9a962/issues/'`. This confirms that the browser remained on the 'Frontend Development' project issues page after the submission, as expected.

Conclusion:
The subtask "Submit New Issue" is **complete**. The Task Agent successfully submitted the new issue, which resulted in the 'Create Issue' dialog closing, the new issue 'Improve Page Loading Speed' appearing in the issue list with its unique identifier 'FRONT-3', and the browser remaining on the correct project issues page.
