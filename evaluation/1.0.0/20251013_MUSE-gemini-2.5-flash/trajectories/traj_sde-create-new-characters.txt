</tools>

2. **Python Code Execution**
When executing Python code, please output:
<code>
... your code ...
</code>
- The working directory is `/workspace`
- Executing dangerous, destructive, or time-consuming code is prohibited.
- If both a **Tool Call** and **Python Code Execution** are included in the output, the tool call takes precedence, and the Python code will not be executed.
- Using outdated or limited python libraries may result in incomplete or inaccurate observations (e.g. missing images from PDFs or failing to extract key content). Always prefer robust, modern libraries to ensure full and reliable results.
- When performing file conversion or data extraction, always ensure **data integrity**. Verify that the structure, content, and critical fields of the source file are preserved in the output. Check row and column counts, headers, and key values before and after processing. **Avoid silent loss**, truncation, or unintended alteration of data.

## Action Execution Result Processing
- After each action is executed, an Observation is returned, which includes:
    1. `<tool_response>`: The result of the tool or code execution.
    2. `<tool_instruction>`: The instruction associated with a specific action, used to guide the next step or restrict subsequent behavior.
- **Note**: Do not fabricate observations.

## Security and Restrictions
- **Coding Actions (such as Python, CMD, etc.)**
    - Do not run high-risk operations that are large in code size or take a long time.
    - Do not execute code that could cause data loss, system damage, or irreversible changes.
    - Do not use the kill command with wildcards like * or other dangerous parameters that could result in a wide range of matches.
    - Prefer using the Python interpreter to execute code (safer and more efficient) rather than using the CMD tool.

> ⚠️ **Important**
> When your output contains content that fully conforms to the **Tool Call** or **Python Code Execution** format, the system will immediately parse, identify, and execute it as an **Action** without further confirmation and without reversal.
> Therefore, before outputting, always confirm that this is your **intended** action and fully assess the potential consequences and risks.
> If you are only using **quotes, demonstrations, or examples**, be sure to break the formatting or escape it to prevent the system from interpreting it as a real action.

# OBJECTIVE #
Your core objective is to independently and efficiently complete the tasks assigned to you by the company.


# MEMORY #
During previous tasks, you have accumulated the following reusable knowledge:

## Resolution Patterns
Comprehensive Contextualization: Systematically acquire and aggregate information from diverse, potentially unstructured sources, prioritizing local processing and cross-validation, to ensure a complete, coherent operational view and inform robust decisions.
Robust External Interaction: Prioritize stable, predictable interaction methods, such as structured APIs, and dynamically adapt strategies to ensure continuity and reliability with external systems despite their inconsistencies or volatility.
Adaptive Constraint Handling: When an objective is blocked by an unresolvable external constraint, acknowledge the limitation, perform necessary cleanup of partial artifacts, and adapt the strategy to proceed with viable data, avoiding unproductive retries.
Modular Resilient Design: Decompose operations into modular, decoupled units with explicit state management, to enhance predictability, isolate errors, improve maintainability, and ensure operational continuity.
Progressive Verification: Implement multi-stage validation, from granular checks within pipelines to comprehensive outcome validation, to localize errors, confirm system states, and ensure successful execution.

## Platform/Application Operation Guides
These guides summarize proven operation paths derived from past successful experiences.  
Each item is a structured reference designed to help you complete operations more quickly, accurately, and with reduced redundancy.

> This directory provides a comprehensive index of guides, compiling best practices and experience summaries for accomplishing various tasks.

### Recommended Usage Process
1. **Review the Guide First**  
   Before starting a task, browse the relevant entries in the directory to identify potentially useful guidance.  
2. **Targeted Access**  
   Use the `access_the_application_guide` tool to view detailed steps if necessary.  
3. **Reuse with Flexibility**  
   Apply past successful steps when they fit the current situation, but stay aware of possible mismatches.  
4. **Explore When Deviations Arise**  
   If the environment or results diverge from the guide, stop rigidly following it and explore alternative approaches through small, safe, and adaptive steps.

### Value of Guides
- Reduce task completion time by leveraging accumulated experience.  
- Lower error rates and avoid common pitfalls.  
- Ensure consistent, professional execution of tasks.  

### Guide Reliability & Adaptation
- Guides may be outdated, biased, or contain errors — they are “historical experience,” not absolute truth.  
- Use guides as starting points, not as strict rules.  
- When deviations or conflicts appear, **exit the guide and explore new paths** instead of persisting.  
- Record useful deviation points for later improvement of the guides.

<task>
For the sotopia project in gitlab (http://the-agent-company.com:8929/), people want to simulate scenarios in the medical domain, create 6 new characters with a doctor as the occupation, and create 6 new characters with a nurse as the occupation. (Create a new branch called `feature/add-new-characters`) 
There should be gender parity among doctors and among nurses, with an equal number of "male" and "female" in each group.
Put them in a single `medical_characters.jsonl` file under the data folder (create one if it is not there), and clone the repo from GitLab to `/workspace` first.
</task>
03. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================
* The information you know and have obtained is:
    1.  The project is "sotopia" hosted on GitLab at `http://the-agent-company.com:8929/`.
    2.  The main goal is to create 12 new characters for medical domain scenarios.
    3.  Six characters should have the occupation "doctor".
    4.  Six characters should have the occupation "nurse".
    5.  There must be gender parity: 3 male doctors, 3 female doctors, 3 male nurses, and 3 female nurses.
    6.  The characters should be saved in a file named `medical_characters.jsonl`.
    7.  This file should be located in a `data` folder within the cloned repository (the `data` folder should be created if it doesn't exist).
    8.  The repository needs to be cloned from GitLab to the `/workspace` directory.
    9.  A new branch named `feature/add-new-characters` must be created.

* The task can be divided into the following subtasks:
    1. Clone GitLab repository: Successfully clone the 'sotopia' repository from GitLab to the `/workspace` directory.
    2. Create new feature branch: Successfully create and switch to a new branch named `feature/add-new-characters`.
    3. Create data directory: Ensure a `data` directory exists within the cloned repository.
    4. Generate medical character data: Create a list of 12 character dictionaries, each with 'occupation' (6 doctors, 6 nurses) and 'gender' (3 male, 3 female for each occupation) properties.
    5. Save characters to JSONL file: Write the generated character data into `medical_characters.jsonl` within the `data` directory, with each character on a new line as a JSON object.
    6. Add and commit changes: Stage and commit the `data/medical_characters.jsonl` file to the `feature/add-new-characters` branch.
    7. Push new branch to GitLab: Push the `feature/add-new-characters` branch and its committed changes to the remote GitLab repository.

Thought: I need to clone a GitLab repository. The relevant guide for GitLab would be "CloneRepository". I should also consider "Login" to ensure I have the correct credentials or understand how to authenticate if needed, though `git clone` typically handles credentials via the URL or SSH keys. For cloning, I will use `run_cmd`.

Thought: I have reviewed the `CloneRepository` guide. It suggests navigating to the project page to get the clone URL. However, I can construct the clone URL directly using the provided GitLab service URL and project name. The project is `sotopia` and the root user is `root`, so the clone URL will be `http://the-agent-company.com:8929/root/sotopia.git`. I will clone this repository into `/workspace/sotopia`. I will use the `run_cmd` tool to execute the `git clone` command.

<task>
For the sotopia project in gitlab (http://the-agent-company.com:8929/), people want to simulate scenarios in the medical domain, create 6 new characters with a doctor as the occupation, and create 6 new characters with a nurse as the occupation. (Create a new branch called `feature/add-new-characters`) 
There should be gender parity among doctors and among nurses, with an equal number of "male" and "female" in each group.
Put them in a single `medical_characters.jsonl` file under the data folder (create one if it is not there), and clone the repo from GitLab to `/workspace` first.

* The information you know and have obtained is:
    1. The project is "sotopia" hosted on GitLab at `http://the-agent-company.com:8929/`.
    2. The main goal is to create 12 new characters for medical domain scenarios.
    3. Six characters should have the occupation "doctor".
    4. Six characters should have the occupation "nurse".
    5. There must be gender parity: 3 male doctors, 3 female doctors, 3 male nurses, and 3 female nurses.
    6. The characters should be saved in a file named `medical_characters.jsonl`.
    7. This file should be located in a `data` folder within the cloned repository (the `data` folder should be created if it doesn't exist).
    8. The repository needs to be cloned from GitLab to the `/workspace` directory, which has been completed, and the repository is now at `/workspace/sotopia`.
    9. A new branch named `feature/add-new-characters` must be created.

* The task can be divided into the following subtasks:
    1. Create new feature branch: Successfully create and switch to a new branch named `feature/add-new-characters` within the `/workspace/sotopia` repository.
    2. Create data directory: Ensure a `data` directory exists at `/workspace/sotopia/data`.
    3. Generate medical character data: Create 12 character dictionaries in Python, with 6 doctors (3 male, 3 female) and 6 nurses (3 male, 3 female), each having 'occupation' and 'gender' attributes.
    4. Save characters to JSONL file: Write the generated character data as JSONL objects to `/workspace/sotopia/data/medical_characters.jsonl`.
    5. Add and commit changes: Stage and commit the `data/medical_characters.jsonl` file to the `feature/add-new-characters` branch with an appropriate commit message.

Goal: Write the generated list of character dictionaries to '/workspace/sotopia/data/medical_characters.jsonl', with each character object on a new line as a JSON string.
45. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================
Thought: The goal is to write the generated list of character dictionaries to a JSONL file. This is a file system operation, so I should look for relevant guides under "System". Specifically, "WriteFile" seems appropriate for writing content to a file.

Thought: I have the `characters` list from the previous subtask. The `WriteFile` guide suggests using Python's `open()` and `write()` functions. I need to iterate through the `characters` list, convert each character dictionary to a JSON string, append a newline character, and then write it to the specified file path: `/workspace/sotopia/data/medical_characters.jsonl`. I will use the `json` module for serialization.

Title: Subtask Completion Report: Save characters to JSONL file

Checklist Details:
- **Check 1: Verify File Existence**
    - **Goal:** Confirm that the file '/workspace/sotopia/data/medical_characters.jsonl' has been created.
    - **Action:** `run_cmd` with command `ls /workspace/sotopia/data/medical_characters.jsonl`
    - **Observation:** `returncode: 0`, `stdout: /workspace/sotopia/data/medical_characters.jsonl`
    - **Result:** **PASS**. The file was found at the specified path.

- **Check 2: Verify File Line Count**
    - **Goal:** Ensure the created file 'medical_characters.jsonl' contains exactly 12 lines, corresponding to the 12 characters.
    - **Action:** `run_cmd` with command `wc -l /workspace/sotopia/data/medical_characters.jsonl`
    - **Observation:** `returncode: 0`, `stdout: 12 /workspace/sotopia/data/medical_characters.jsonl`
    - **Result:** **PASS**. The file contains exactly 12 lines, as expected.

- **Check 3: Validate File Content and Structure**
    - **Goal:** Read the content of 'medical_characters.jsonl', parse each line as a JSON object, and verify that the file contains the correct number of doctors (6) and nurses (6), with gender parity (3 male, 3 female for each occupation group).
    - **Action:** Python code was executed to read, parse, and validate the content of the JSONL file.
    - **Observation:** The `stdout` from the Python script explicitly confirmed: `Total characters found: 12`, `Doctors - Male: 3, Female: 3`, `Nurses - Male: 3, Female: 3`, and `Content and structure validation successful.`.
    - **Result:** **PASS**. The file content and structure are correct, with the expected distribution of occupations and genders.

Conclusion:
The Subtask "Save characters to JSONL file" is **complete**. The `medical_characters.jsonl` file has been successfully created, contains the correct number of lines, and its content matches the specified requirements for character data and structure.

<task>
For the sotopia project in gitlab (http://the-agent-company.com:8929/), people want to simulate scenarios in the medical domain, create 6 new characters with a doctor as the occupation, and create 6 new characters with a nurse as the occupation. (Create a new branch called `feature/add-new-characters`) 
There should be gender parity among doctors and among nurses, with an equal number of "male" and "female" in each group.
Put them in a single `medical_characters.jsonl` file under the data folder (create one if it is not there), and clone the repo from GitLab to `/workspace` first.

    3. Six characters should have the occupation "doctor".
    4. Six characters should have the occupation "nurse".
    5. There must be gender parity: 3 male doctors, 3 female doctors, 3 male nurses, and 3 female nurses.
    6. The characters should be saved in a file named `medical_characters.jsonl`.
    7. This file should be located in a `data` folder within the cloned repository.
    8. The repository has been successfully cloned from GitLab to `/workspace/sotopia`.
    9. A new branch named `feature/add-new-characters` has been successfully created and checked out in the `/workspace/sotopia` repository.
    10. The `data` directory has been successfully created at `/workspace/sotopia/data`.
    11. A list of 12 character dictionaries (6 doctors with 3 male/3 female, 6 nurses with 3 male/3 female) has been successfully generated in Python and is ready to be written to a file.
    12. The generated list of character dictionaries has been successfully written to `/workspace/sotopia/data/medical_characters.jsonl`, with each character object on a new line as a JSON string.

- **Check 3: Verify File Existence and Content on Remote Branch**
    - **Goal:** Confirm that the 'data/medical_characters.jsonl' file exists on the 'feature/add-new-characters' branch on GitLab and its content reflects the changes made in previous subtasks by inspecting the file content in the GitLab UI.
    - **Action:** `browser_go_to_url` to `http://the-agent-company.com:8929/root/sotopia/-/blob/feature/add-new-characters/data/medical_characters.jsonl`.
    - **Observation:** The `webpage accessibility tree` for the navigated page showed the content of `medical_characters.jsonl`. It contained 12 lines, with 3 entries for `{"occupation": "doctor", "gender": "male"}`, 3 for `{"occupation": "doctor", "gender": "female"}`, 3 for `{"occupation": "nurse", "gender": "male"}`, and 3 for `{"occupation": "nurse", "gender": "female"}`.
    - **Result:** **PASS**. The `data/medical_characters.jsonl` file exists on the remote branch, and its content accurately matches the expected character data distribution.

Conclusion:
The Subtask "Push new branch to GitLab" is **complete**. The new `feature/add-new-characters` branch has been successfully pushed to the remote GitLab repository, and the `medical_characters.jsonl` file within it is correctly present and contains the expected data.

<task>
For the sotopia project in gitlab (http://the-agent-company.com:8929/), people want to simulate scenarios in the medical domain, create 6 new characters with a doctor as the occupation, and create 6 new characters with a nurse as the occupation. (Create a new branch called `feature/add-new-characters`) 
There should be gender parity among doctors and among nurses, with an equal number of "male" and "female" in each group.
Put them in a single `medical_characters.jsonl` file under the data folder (create one if it is not there), and clone the repo from GitLab to `/workspace` first.
</task>
81. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================
* The information you know and have obtained is:
    1. The project is "sotopia" hosted on GitLab at `http://the-agent-company.com:8929/`.
    2. The main goal was to create 12 new characters for medical domain scenarios.
    3. Six characters should have the occupation "doctor" and six should have the occupation "nurse".
    4. There must be gender parity: 3 male doctors, 3 female doctors, 3 male nurses, and 3 female nurses.
    5. The characters should be saved in a file named `medical_characters.jsonl`.
    6. This file should be located in a `data` folder within the cloned repository (the `data` folder should be created if it doesn't exist).
    7. The repository needed to be cloned from GitLab to the `/workspace` directory first. This has been completed, and the repository is located at `/workspace/sotopia`.
    8. A new branch named `feature/add-new-characters` needed to be created. This has been completed and the branch is active.
    9. The `data` directory has been successfully created at `/workspace/sotopia/data`.
    10. A list of 12 character dictionaries (6 doctors with 3 male/3 female, 6 nurses with 3 male/3 female) has been successfully generated in Python.
    11. The generated list of character dictionaries has been successfully written to `/workspace/sotopia/data/medical_characters.jsonl` in JSONL format.
    12. The `data/medical_characters.jsonl` file has been successfully staged and committed to the `feature/add-new-characters` branch with the commit message "feat: Add medical character data".
    13. The `feature/add-new-characters` branch, including the new commit, has been successfully pushed to the remote GitLab repository, and its existence and content have been verified.

* The task can be divided into the following subtasks:
