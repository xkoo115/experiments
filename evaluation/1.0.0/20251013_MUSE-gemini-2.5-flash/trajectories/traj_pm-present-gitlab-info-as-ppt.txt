</tools>

2. **Python Code Execution**
When executing Python code, please output:
<code>
... your code ...
</code>
- The working directory is `/workspace`
- Executing dangerous, destructive, or time-consuming code is prohibited.
- If both a **Tool Call** and **Python Code Execution** are included in the output, the tool call takes precedence, and the Python code will not be executed.
- Using outdated or limited python libraries may result in incomplete or inaccurate observations (e.g. missing images from PDFs or failing to extract key content). Always prefer robust, modern libraries to ensure full and reliable results.
- When performing file conversion or data extraction, always ensure **data integrity**. Verify that the structure, content, and critical fields of the source file are preserved in the output. Check row and column counts, headers, and key values before and after processing. **Avoid silent loss**, truncation, or unintended alteration of data.

## Action Execution Result Processing
- After each action is executed, an Observation is returned, which includes:
    1. `<tool_response>`: The result of the tool or code execution.
    2. `<tool_instruction>`: The instruction associated with a specific action, used to guide the next step or restrict subsequent behavior.
- **Note**: Do not fabricate observations.

## Security and Restrictions
- **Coding Actions (such as Python, CMD, etc.)**
    - Do not run high-risk operations that are large in code size or take a long time.
    - Do not execute code that could cause data loss, system damage, or irreversible changes.
    - Do not use the kill command with wildcards like * or other dangerous parameters that could result in a wide range of matches.
    - Prefer using the Python interpreter to execute code (safer and more efficient) rather than using the CMD tool.

> ⚠️ **Important**
> When your output contains content that fully conforms to the **Tool Call** or **Python Code Execution** format, the system will immediately parse, identify, and execute it as an **Action** without further confirmation and without reversal.
> Therefore, before outputting, always confirm that this is your **intended** action and fully assess the potential consequences and risks.
> If you are only using **quotes, demonstrations, or examples**, be sure to break the formatting or escape it to prevent the system from interpreting it as a real action.

# OBJECTIVE #
Your core objective is to independently and efficiently complete the tasks assigned to you by the company.


# MEMORY #
During previous tasks, you have accumulated the following reusable knowledge:

## Resolution Patterns
Comprehensive Contextualization: Systematically acquire and aggregate information from diverse, potentially unstructured sources, prioritizing local processing and cross-validation, to ensure a complete, coherent operational view and inform robust decisions.
Robust External Interaction: Prioritize stable, predictable interaction methods, such as structured APIs, and dynamically adapt strategies to ensure continuity and reliability with external systems despite their inconsistencies or volatility.
Adaptive Constraint Handling: When an objective is blocked by an unresolvable external constraint, acknowledge the limitation, perform necessary cleanup of partial artifacts, and adapt the strategy to proceed with viable data, avoiding unproductive retries.
Modular Resilient Design: Decompose operations into modular, decoupled units with explicit state management, to enhance predictability, isolate errors, improve maintainability, and ensure operational continuity.
Progressive Verification: Implement multi-stage validation, from granular checks within pipelines to comprehensive outcome validation, to localize errors, confirm system states, and ensure successful execution.

### Recommended Usage Process
1. **Review the Guide First**  
   Before starting a task, browse the relevant entries in the directory to identify potentially useful guidance.  
2. **Targeted Access**  
   Use the `access_the_application_guide` tool to view detailed steps if necessary.  
3. **Reuse with Flexibility**  
   Apply past successful steps when they fit the current situation, but stay aware of possible mismatches.  
4. **Explore When Deviations Arise**  
   If the environment or results diverge from the guide, stop rigidly following it and explore alternative approaches through small, safe, and adaptive steps.

### Value of Guides
- Reduce task completion time by leveraging accumulated experience.  
- Lower error rates and avoid common pitfalls.  
- Ensure consistent, professional execution of tasks.  

### Guide Reliability & Adaptation
- Guides may be outdated, biased, or contain errors — they are “historical experience,” not absolute truth.  
- Use guides as starting points, not as strict rules.  
- When deviations or conflicts appear, **exit the guide and explore new paths** instead of persisting.  
- Record useful deviation points for later improvement of the guides.

If an `Element index does not exist` error is returned, it indicates extreme element volatility. **Always re-evaluate `webpage interactive elements` with `browser_wait_and_get_update` immediately before attempting a click, and crucially, confirm the element's `text` or `aria-label` attribute semantically matches the intended target.** If direct clicking by index proves unreliable, *especially within dynamic lists or sidebars (e.g., chat contact lists)*, consider alternative strategies like using an application's built-in search functionality or `browser_go_to_url` if a direct link is known, rather than repeatedly retrying. For form submissions or general action triggers, `browser_send_keys` with 'Enter' is a more robust alternative and **highly recommended for reliability**.

<task>
Our CTO, Sarah Johnson, want to know more on the engineering progress we've been made throughtout the past few months, so she requested a presentation introducing all gitlab repositories we have now. You can access this at http://the-agent-company.com:8929/  You will need to create a slide deck, with an introductory page titled "Overview of Our Engineering Progress". Then for each gitlab repository, create one slide including the repo name, its description, and the number of all issues and merge requests (including open, closed/merged, etc.)
Save the presentation to '/workspace/Engineering_Progress.pptx'. Make sure the repo slides are ordered as displayed on http://the-agent-company.com:8929/
</task>
19. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================

Thought: The guide for `ListRepositories` suggests using `browser_wait_and_get_update()` and then iterating through `webpage interactive elements` to extract repository names and URLs. I need to use Python code to parse the `href` attributes to identify the repositories. I also need to find the descriptions, which are not explicitly mentioned in the guide's extraction steps, so I will need to look for them in the interactive elements.

First, I need to ensure the browser state is up-to-date by calling `browser_wait_and_get_update()`.

Thought: The previous Python code failed because I directly used the `<webpage interactive elements>` and `<webpage accessibility tree>` placeholders within the code. I need to capture the content of these placeholders from the observation and pass them as actual string variables to the Python script.

My next step is to execute the Python code again, but this time, I will ensure that the `interactive_elements` and `accessibility_tree` variables are correctly populated with the content from the previous `browser_wait_and_get_update` observation. I will use the actual content from the observation.

I will refine the Python code to correctly parse the `interactive_elements` and `accessibility_tree` to extract the repository name, description, issues count, and merge requests count. I need to be careful about how I extract the description, as it appears in a `paragraph` tag within the `listitem` block. The issue and merge request counts are associated with `link` tags that have specific `title` attributes and `href` patterns.

Let's try to execute the Python code with the actual content from the previous observation.

Thought: The previous attempt to extract descriptions and counts was not entirely successful. The descriptions were empty, and issues/merge requests were all '0'. I have identified the issues with the regex patterns and the source of information (accessibility tree for description, interactive elements for counts).

I have refined the Python code to:
1. Correctly parse `interactive_elements_str` and `accessibility_tree_str`.
2. Iterate through `interactive_elements` to find project links.
3. For each project, extract the `repo_name`.
4. Search the `accessibility_tree` for the `listitem` block corresponding to the `repo_name` to extract the `description`. I've added more robust regex for description extraction, including handling cases with emojis and direct `StaticText` after the heading.
5. Search the `interactive_elements` for links ending with `/-/issues` and `/-/merge_requests` associated with the current `repo_name` to extract the `issues_count` and `merge_requests_count`. The counts are extracted from the `text` attribute of these interactive elements.

I will execute the revised Python code to get the correct project details.

The previous code execution resulted in incorrect issue/merge request counts (all 0) and some incorrect descriptions. The issue was primarily in the regex used to extract the numerical values from the `text` attribute of the interactive elements, and a slight refinement was needed for description extraction.

I will modify the Python code to:
1. Correctly parse the `issues_count` and `merge_requests_count` from the `text` attribute of the interactive elements. The `text` attribute contains the full HTML tag, e.g., `<a title=Issues>28/>`, so the regex needs to specifically target the number within this string.
2. Refine the description extraction logic to be more robust, ensuring it captures descriptions correctly from `paragraph` tags and avoids picking up parts of the heading or other non-description text.

33. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================
Thought: The previous code execution still has issues with description extraction and issue/merge request counts for some repositories.

For descriptions:
- "api-server" and "copilot-arena-server" still show "Administrator /" which is part of the heading, not the description. This means the fallback logic for description extraction is still flawed or the `paragraph` tag is missing for these. If no explicit description is found, it should be an empty string.
- "doc" still has an empty description.
- "openhands" has "🙌" as its description, meaning the emoji is captured but the text following it is not properly concatenated or extracted.

For issues and merge requests:
- "api-server", "copilot-arena-server", "doc", and "raft" still show "0" for both issues and merge requests. This is likely due to the regex used to extract the numbers from the interactive element's text. The previous regex `r'>(\d+\.?\d*k?)/'` was incorrect because the closing tag is `</a>` or just `>` not `/>`. It should be `r'>(\d+\.?\d*k?)<'`.

I will modify the Python code to address these specific issues:
1.  **Description Extraction**:
    *   Ensure that if a `paragraph` tag is found, it correctly extracts the content, including handling emojis and subsequent text.
    *   If no `paragraph` tag is found, the description should default to an empty string, preventing partial heading text from being used.
2.  **Issue/Merge Request Count Extraction**:
    *   Correct the regex to `r'>(\d+\.?\d*k?)<'` to accurately capture the numbers from the interactive element's `text` attribute.

35. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================
Thought: The previous attempt to extract project details still had inaccuracies, particularly with issue/merge request counts and descriptions.

**Analysis of `tool_response`:**
- **Issue/Merge Request Counts:** For several projects (e.g., `api-server`, `bustub`, `colly`, `copilot-arena-server`, `doc`, `janusgraph`, `llama.cpp`, `node-red`, `openhands`), the issues and merge requests counts are still reported as '0'. This is incorrect based on the `interactive_elements_str` provided, where some projects clearly show non-zero counts (e.g., `bustub` has 28 issues and 14 merge requests). The regex `r'>(\d+\.?\d*k?)<'` used in the previous attempt was looking for a closing `<` character, but the actual `text` attribute often ends with `/>` (e.g., `<a title=Issues>28/>`). This mismatch caused the regex to fail for many entries.
- **Descriptions:**
    - `api-server` and `copilot-arena-server` still have empty descriptions. This is expected if they truly don't have a description in the accessibility tree under a `paragraph` tag.
    - `doc` has an empty description, but the accessibility tree explicitly shows `paragraph '' StaticText 'Wiki for company-wide doc'`. This indicates the description extraction logic is still not correctly capturing text from `StaticText` within a `paragraph` tag.
    - `openhands` description is just `🙌`, missing the text "OpenHands: Code Less, Make More". This suggests the regex for descriptions with emojis is not capturing the subsequent text.

**Next Steps:**
I need to refine the Python code to address these specific issues:

1.  **Issue/Merge Request Count Extraction**:
    *   Modify the regex to correctly parse the count from the `text` attribute, accommodating both `>` and `/>` as potential closing tags for the number. A more robust regex would be `r'>(\d+\.?\d*k?)[/<]'`. This will capture the number followed by either `/` or `<`.

2.  **Description Extraction**:
    *   The current regex `r"paragraph ''\s+(?:generic '[^']*'\s+)?StaticText '(.*?)'"` is too specific. I need a more general approach that, once a `paragraph` element is identified within a project's `listitem` block, collects *all* `StaticText` content that follows within that paragraph, regardless of intervening `generic` tags or multiple `StaticText` entries.
    *   If no `paragraph` tag is found for a project, the description should explicitly remain an empty string.

I will execute the refined Python code.

Thought: The previous attempt to extract project details shows that the issue and merge request counts are now correctly extracted for all projects, including those that previously showed '0'. This is a significant improvement. The problem with descriptions, however, persists for some projects.

**Analysis of `tool_response`:**
- **Issue/Merge Request Counts:** All counts now appear correct based on the provided `interactive_elements_str`. For example, `bustub` now correctly shows Issues: 28, Merge Requests: 14. This confirms the regex `r'(\d+\.?\d*k?)'` and the general approach for counts is working.
- **Descriptions:**
    - `api-server` and `copilot-arena-server` still have empty descriptions. This is likely correct as their corresponding `listitem` blocks in the `accessibility_tree` do not contain a `paragraph` tag with a description.
    - `doc` still has an empty description. This is incorrect, as the `accessibility_tree` clearly shows `paragraph '' StaticText 'Wiki for company-wide doc'`. My refined logic for description extraction should have caught this. The issue might be in how `in_paragraph` or `paragraph_indent` is handled, or if the `paragraph` line itself is not correctly identified.
    - `openhands` now correctly shows "🙌 OpenHands: Code Less, Make More". This is a good improvement, meaning the logic for combining `StaticText` within a paragraph is working for cases with emojis.
    - `bustub`, `colly`, `janusgraph`, `llama.cpp`, `node-red`, `opensearch`, `risingwave`, `sotopia`, `streamlit` all have correct descriptions now. This indicates the new description extraction logic is mostly working.

**Remaining Issue:**
The only remaining issue is the `doc` repository's description. Let's re-examine its `accessibility_tree` block:
```

The `paragraph ''` line is indeed present, and `StaticText 'Wiki for company-wide doc'` is directly under it. My current code:
```python
                description_parts = []
                in_paragraph = False
                for line in repo_block_lines:
                    if "paragraph ''" in line:
                        in_paragraph = True
                        paragraph_indent = get_indent(line)
                        continue # Skip the paragraph line itself
                    
                    if in_paragraph:
                        current_indent = get_indent(line)
                        if current_indent > paragraph_indent:
                            static_text_match = re.search(r"StaticText '(.*?)'", line)
                            if static_text_match:
                                description_parts.append(static_text_match.group(1).strip())
                        else: # End of paragraph block
                            in_paragraph = False
                            break
                description = " ".join(description_parts).strip()
```
The logic seems sound. The `continue` statement means the `paragraph ''` line itself is skipped, and then it correctly checks for lines with greater indentation.
The problem might be that `repo_block_lines` itself might not contain the full context, or the `paragraph` line is not found as expected.
Let's double check the `repo_block_lines` for 'doc'.

The `repo_block_lines` is correctly formed.
The `paragraph ''` line is at a certain indentation, and `StaticText 'Wiki for company-wide doc'` is at a greater indentation. This should be captured.

Could it be that the `get_indent` function is not working as expected for these specific lines, or there's some subtle character difference?
Let's add some print statements to debug the description extraction for `doc`.
However, I cannot add print statements and re-run.

Let's rethink the description extraction slightly. Instead of relying purely on `in_paragraph` and indentation, let's make it simpler: find the `paragraph` line, then find the *next* `StaticText` line that is *more indented* than the `paragraph` line. This should be the description.

Revised Description Extraction Logic (simplified):
1.  Find the line containing `paragraph ''`.
2.  If found, get its line number (`para_line_num`).
3.  Iterate from `para_line_num + 1` through `repo_block_lines`.
4.  For each subsequent line, if it contains `StaticText '...'` and its indentation is greater than the `paragraph`'s indentation, extract that `StaticText`. This should be the description. Break after finding the first one, or concatenate if multiple are found (as for openhands).

Let's try to make the description extraction more robust by searching the whole `repo_block_str` for the pattern `paragraph ''` followed by any `StaticText` (potentially with `generic` in between).

```python
                description = ""
                # Search for the paragraph block and extract its StaticText content
                # This regex looks for 'paragraph', then optionally 'generic', then 'StaticText' and captures its content
                desc_match = re.search(r"paragraph ''\s*(?:generic '[^']*'\s*)?StaticText '(.*?)'", repo_block_str, re.DOTALL)
                if desc_match:
                    description = desc_match.group(1).strip()
                else:
                    # For cases like openhands, where there might be multiple StaticText within the paragraph block
                    # after an emoji or other generic element.
                    # Find the paragraph block
                    paragraph_block_match = re.search(r"(paragraph '')([\s\S]*?)(?=\n\s*\S|\Z)", repo_block_str)
                    if paragraph_block_match:
                        paragraph_content = paragraph_block_match.group(2)
                        # Extract all StaticText within this content
                        all_static_texts = re.findall(r"StaticText '(.*?)'", paragraph_content)
                        description = " ".join([text.strip() for text in all_static_texts if text.strip()])
                        description = description.strip()
```
This new regex strategy for description is more direct. It first tries to find a single `StaticText` directly after an optional `generic` within the paragraph block. If that doesn't yield results (e.g., for `openhands` with multiple `StaticText` parts), it tries to capture the entire content *after* the `paragraph ''` line until the indentation changes significantly (or end of block), and then extracts all `StaticText` from that captured content.

Let's re-run with this refined description extraction.

Final check on the overall task goal: "create one slide including the repo name, its description, and the number of all issues and merge requests (including open, closed/merged, etc.)". The current extraction aims to get all these pieces of information. Once this is accurate, this subtask will be complete.

Always check `command_result.returncode`: `0` indicates success; non-zero suggests an error; analyze `command_result.stderr`. For successful commands, process `command_result.stdout`. *Note: `command_result.stderr` may contain non-error information; evaluate contextually.* **Crucially, for any sequence of shell commands or when integrating shell output with Python logic, *always encapsulate the entire interaction within a single Python script using `subprocess`* for maximum robustness and control, rather than relying on discrete `run_cmd` calls or shell features like redirection.**
</tool_instruction>

47. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================
Thought: The `pip install python-pptx` command executed successfully, as indicated by `returncode: 0`. The `stdout` clearly states "Requirement already satisfied: python-pptx", which means the library is already installed and available. The warnings in `stderr` are not critical and do not prevent the library from being used. Therefore, the goal of installing the `python-pptx` library has been achieved.
Final Answer: The `python-pptx` library is successfully installed (or was already installed).

Title: Subtask 3: Install python-pptx library - Completion Verification Report

Checklist Details:
1.  **Verify_Command_Execution_Status**: Confirmed. The `pip install python-pptx` command was executed by the Task Agent, and the `tool_response` in <reference_content>USER MESSAGE 05</reference_content> shows `returncode: 0`, indicating a successful command execution.
2.  **Verify_Library_Availability**: Confirmed. Proactive verification by executing Python code to import and instantiate `pptx.Presentation` resulted in `"python-pptx library is functional."` being printed to `stdout` (as observed in the `tool_response` following the second Python code execution). This confirms that the `python-pptx` library is successfully installed, importable, and functional within the environment.

Conclusion:
The Subtask "Install python-pptx library" has been successfully completed. The `pip install` command executed without error, and independent verification confirms that the `python-pptx` library is available and functional, ready for use in subsequent steps.

SubTask4: Create and Save Presentation
Goal: Generate a PowerPoint presentation with an introductory slide titled 'Overview of Our Engineering Progress', followed by a dedicated slide for each GitLab repository (in the extracted order) detailing its name, description, and counts of issues and merge requests, and save the final presentation to '/workspace/Engineering_Progress.pptx'.

Thought: I have the data for all repositories and the `python-pptx` library is installed. I will now proceed to write the Python code to generate the PowerPoint presentation. I don't need to access any specific guide for this, as I will be directly using the `python-pptx` library's functionalities.

The structure of the presentation will be:
1.  A title slide: "Overview of Our Engineering Progress".
2.  For each repository, a separate slide with:
    *   Repository Name (as slide title)
    *   Description
    *   Issues Count
    *   Merge Requests Count

I will use a standard slide layout for the title slide and a title-and-content layout for the repository slides.

Title: Subtask 4: Create and Save Presentation - Completion Verification Report

Checklist Details:
1.  **Verify_Presentation_File_Existence**: Confirmed. The `ls -l /workspace/Engineering_Progress.pptx` command successfully returned file details, indicating the presentation file exists at the specified path. (Reference: `stdout` in Observation for CheckStep:Verify_Presentation_File_Existence)
2.  **Verify_Presentation_File_Integrity_and_Slide_Count**: Confirmed. Python code successfully opened the `Engineering_Progress.pptx` file and reported "Presentation has 15 slides." (Reference: `stdout` in Observation for CheckStep:Verify_Presentation_File_Integrity_and_Slide_Count). This matches the expected 1 introductory slide + 14 repository slides.
3.  **Verify_Introductory_Slide_Content**: Confirmed. Python code extracted the title of the first slide as "Overview of Our Engineering Progress", which matches the expected title. (Reference: `stdout` in Observation for CheckStep:Verify_Introductory_Slide_Content)
4.  **Verify_Repository_Slides_Content_and_Order**: Confirmed. Python code verified a sample of repository slides (first, middle, and last) and found that for each, the name, description, issues count, and merge request count matched the `repositories_data` used by the agent. The output "All sampled repository slides match expected data: True" confirms correct content and order. (Reference: `stdout` in Observation for CheckStep:Verify_Repository_Slides_Content_and_Order)

Conclusion:
The Subtask "Create and Save Presentation" has been successfully completed. All verification checks confirm that the Task Agent has correctly generated the PowerPoint presentation with the required introductory slide and repository-specific slides, including accurate content and order, and saved it to the specified file path.

Please comprehensively review the entire task execution process, including all subtasks and the contextual information collected.  
Cross-check carefully against the overall task requirements:

1. **Completeness Check**: Ensure every aspect of the requirements has been addressed. Confirm that no items were skipped, postponed, or only partially completed.  
2. **Consistency Check**: Verify that all intermediate results are logically coherent and data-wise consistent with the final conclusions. There should be no contradictions, missing steps, or unexplained gaps.  
3. **Final Completion Confirmation**:  
   - If any requirements remain unfinished or results are insufficient, explicitly list the next subtasks to resolve them.  
   - If all requirements are fully and correctly met, return an empty task plan to indicate the task is completely finished.  

Always remember that your ultimate goal is to complete task:

Our CTO, Sarah Johnson, want to know more on the engineering progress we've been made throughtout the past few months, so she requested a presentation introducing all gitlab repositories we have now. You can access this at http://the-agent-company.com:8929/  You will need to create a slide deck, with an introductory page titled "Overview of Our Engineering Progress". Then for each gitlab repository, create one slide including the repo name, its description, and the number of all issues and merge requests (including open, closed/merged, etc.)
Save the presentation to '/workspace/Engineering_Progress.pptx'. Make sure the repo slides are ordered as displayed on http://the-agent-company.com:8929/
