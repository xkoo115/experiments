# ACTION #
During task execution, you can perform **Actions**, including:
1. **Tool Call**
2. **Python Code Execution**

## Action Output Format
1. **Tool Call**
When calling a tool, please output:
<tool_call>
{"name": "<function-name>", "arguments": <args-json-object>}
</tool_call>
- `<function-name>`: Tool function name

2. **Python Code Execution**
When executing Python code, please output:
<code>
... your code ...
</code>
- The working directory is `/workspace`
- Executing dangerous, destructive, or time-consuming code is prohibited.
- If both a **Tool Call** and **Python Code Execution** are included in the output, the tool call takes precedence, and the Python code will not be executed.
- Using outdated or limited python libraries may result in incomplete or inaccurate observations (e.g. missing images from PDFs or failing to extract key content). Always prefer robust, modern libraries to ensure full and reliable results.
- When performing file conversion or data extraction, always ensure **data integrity**. Verify that the structure, content, and critical fields of the source file are preserved in the output. Check row and column counts, headers, and key values before and after processing. **Avoid silent loss**, truncation, or unintended alteration of data.

## Action Execution Result Processing
- After each action is executed, an Observation is returned, which includes:
    1. `<tool_response>`: The result of the tool or code execution.
    2. `<tool_instruction>`: The instruction associated with a specific action, used to guide the next step or restrict subsequent behavior.
- **Note**: Do not fabricate observations.

## Security and Restrictions
- **Coding Actions (such as Python, CMD, etc.)**
    - Do not run high-risk operations that are large in code size or take a long time.
    - Do not execute code that could cause data loss, system damage, or irreversible changes.
    - Do not use the kill command with wildcards like * or other dangerous parameters that could result in a wide range of matches.
    - Prefer using the Python interpreter to execute code (safer and more efficient) rather than using the CMD tool.

> ⚠️ **Important**
> When your output contains content that fully conforms to the **Tool Call** or **Python Code Execution** format, the system will immediately parse, identify, and execute it as an **Action** without further confirmation and without reversal.
> Therefore, before outputting, always confirm that this is your **intended** action and fully assess the potential consequences and risks.
> If you are only using **quotes, demonstrations, or examples**, be sure to break the formatting or escape it to prevent the system from interpreting it as a real action.

# OBJECTIVE #
Your core objective is to independently and efficiently complete the tasks assigned to you by the company.


# MEMORY #
During previous tasks, you have accumulated the following reusable knowledge:

## Resolution Patterns
Comprehensive Contextualization: Systematically acquire and aggregate information from diverse, potentially unstructured sources, prioritizing local processing and cross-validation, to ensure a complete, coherent operational view and inform robust decisions.
Robust External Interaction: Prioritize stable, predictable interaction methods, such as structured APIs, and dynamically adapt strategies to ensure continuity and reliability with external systems despite their inconsistencies or volatility.
Adaptive Constraint Handling: When an objective is blocked by an unresolvable external constraint, acknowledge the limitation, perform necessary cleanup of partial artifacts, and adapt the strategy to proceed with viable data, avoiding unproductive retries.
Modular Resilient Design: Decompose operations into modular, decoupled units with explicit state management, to enhance predictability, isolate errors, improve maintainability, and ensure operational continuity.
Progressive Verification: Implement multi-stage validation, from granular checks within pipelines to comprehensive outcome validation, to localize errors, confirm system states, and ensure successful execution.

> This directory provides a comprehensive index of guides, compiling best practices and experience summaries for accomplishing various tasks.

### Recommended Usage Process
1. **Review the Guide First**  
   Before starting a task, browse the relevant entries in the directory to identify potentially useful guidance.  
2. **Targeted Access**  
   Use the `access_the_application_guide` tool to view detailed steps if necessary.  
3. **Reuse with Flexibility**  
   Apply past successful steps when they fit the current situation, but stay aware of possible mismatches.  
4. **Explore When Deviations Arise**  
   If the environment or results diverge from the guide, stop rigidly following it and explore alternative approaches through small, safe, and adaptive steps.

### Value of Guides
- Reduce task completion time by leveraging accumulated experience.  
- Lower error rates and avoid common pitfalls.  
- Ensure consistent, professional execution of tasks.  

### Guide Reliability & Adaptation
- Guides may be outdated, biased, or contain errors — they are “historical experience,” not absolute truth.  
- Use guides as starting points, not as strict rules.  
- When deviations or conflicts appear, **exit the guide and explore new paths** instead of persisting.  
- Record useful deviation points for later improvement of the guides.

# Project Specification

Consider the problem of keeping track of the number of unique users accessing a website in a single day. Although this is straightforward with a small site only visited by a few people, it is much more difficult when dealing with a large site with billions of users. In such cases, storing each user in a list and checking for duplicates is impractical. The sheer volume of data leads to significant challenges, including running out of memory, slow processing times, and other inefficiencies.

The HyperLogLog (HLL) is a probablistic data structure that tracks the cardinality of large data sets. HyperLogLog is suited for scenarios like the above, where the goal is to count the number of unique items in a massive data stream without explicitly storing every item. HLL relies on a clever hashing mechanism and a compact data structure to provide accurate estimates of unique users while using only a fraction of the memory required by traditional methods. This makes HLL an essential tool in modern database analytics.

HLL provides probabilistic counting mechanism based on the following parameters:

*   **b** - Number of initial bits in a binary representation of a hash value
*   **m** - number of registers (or also called buckets) - can be considered as a memory block. They are equal to 2^b. (The terms "buckets" and "registers" can be used interchangeably when discussing HyperLogLog and tasks).
*   **p** - leftmost position of 1 (MSBs position of 1)

Consider a simple example of how this algorithm works using the string "A great database is a great life". First, the string is hashed to produce a hash value, which is then converted into its binary representation. From the hash value (binary form), `b` bits are extracted, starting from the most significant bit(MSB). The register value is calculated from the extracted bits. (by default each register has a value of `0`).

From the remaining set of bits, the position of the leftmost 1 is obtained (MSB), i.e the number of leading zeros from left plus 1 (as given in the picture given below).

### Diagram Explanation

The diagram illustrates this process:

*   **Input string:** `x = "A great database is a great life"`
*   **Parameter:** `For b=3,`
*   The string is hashed via `HASH(x)`.
*   The resulting binary hash is shown, with the first `b` bits used for the index.
    *   **Index bits (`b'` bits for index):** `0 0 0`
    *   **Remaining bits:** `0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0`
*   The position of the first '1' in the remaining bits is identified.
    *   **Position of leftmost 1 = 5**

Thought: The previous attempt to extract content using `browser_extract_content_by_vision` failed to correctly identify the "Instructions" heading, even though it's visible in the accessibility tree. This suggests that relying solely on visual extraction for precise section identification might be unreliable in this case. I will now extract all the visible text content from the main part of the page and then use Python to programmatically find the "Instructions" section and everything that follows it. This two-step approach (broad extraction + precise programmatic parsing) should be more robust.

Performed browser action: Implement HyperLogLog Algorithm

Open Imported Issue created 11 months ago by Administrator

Project Specification

Consider the problem of keeping track of the number of unique users accessing a website in a single day. Although this is straightforward with a small site only visited by a few people, it is much more difficult when dealing with a large site with billions of users. In such cases, storing each user in a list and checking for duplicates is impractical. The sheer volume of data leads to significant challenges, including running out of memory, slow processing times, and other inefficiencies.

The HyperLogLog (HLL) is a probabilistic data structure that tracks the cardinality of large data sets. HyperLogLog is suited for scenarios like the above, where the goal is to count the number of unique items in a massive data stream without explicitly storing every item. HLL relies on a clever hashing mechanism and a compact data structure to provide accurate estimates of unique users while using only a fraction of the memory required by traditional methods. This makes HLL an essential tool in modern database analytics.

HLL provides probabilistic counting mechanism based on the following parameters:

- b - Number of initial bits in a binary representation of a hash value
- m - number of registers (or also called buckets) - can be considered as a memory block. They are equal to 2^b. (The terms "buckets" and "registers" can be used interchangeably when discussing HyperLogLog and tasks).
- p - leftmost position of 1 (MSBs position of 1)

Consider a simple example of how this algorithm works using the string "A great database is a great life". First, the string is hashed to produce a hash value, which is then converted into its binary representation. From the hash value (binary form), b bits are extracted, starting from the most significant bit(MSB). The register value is calculated from the extracted bits. (by default each register has a value of 0).

From the remaining set of bits, the position of the leftmost 1 is obtained (MSB), i.e the number of leading zeros from left plus 1 (as given in the picture given below).

## Subtask Verification Report

**Title**: Verification of Subtask 1: Navigate to GitLab Issue Page and Extract Instructions to OwnCloud

**Checklist Details**:

1.  **Check 1: Local File Existence**
    *   **Goal**: Verify that the file named 'bustub_issue_759_instructions.md' has been created in the `/workspace/` directory.
    *   **Result**: Passed. The file `/workspace/bustub_issue_759_instructions.md` exists as confirmed by `ls -l`.

2.  **Check 2: Local File Content - Start and Completeness**
    *   **Goal**: Examine the content of 'bustub_issue_759_instructions.md' to ensure it starts with the section titled 'Instructions' and includes all subsequent plain text content from the GitLab issue page.
    *   **Result**: Failed. The file `bustub_issue_759_instructions.md` contains raw accessibility tree data rather than the expected plain text instructions. The Task Agent incorrectly saved the entire `tool_response` (which included accessibility tree details) from `browser_extract_content_by_vision` instead of just the extracted plain text.

3.  **Check 3: OwnCloud Upload Status**
    *   **Goal**: Confirm whether the file 'bustub_issue_759_instructions.md' has been successfully uploaded to the OwnCloud page at 'http://the-agent-company.com:8092'.
    *   **Result**: Failed. The Task Agent's execution trajectory shows no actions (tool calls or code executions) related to navigating to the OwnCloud URL, logging in, or uploading the file. Therefore, the file has not been uploaded as required by the subtask.

**Conclusion**:
The current Subtask is **not complete**.
The primary reasons are:
1.  The content extracted and saved to `bustub_issue_759_instructions.md` is incorrect; it contains raw accessibility tree data instead of the required plain text instructions.
2.  The file was never uploaded to the OwnCloud page, as no relevant actions were performed by the Task Agent to interact with OwnCloud.
</check_report>

Based on analyzing the current Subtask, its goal, and **your Subtask's execution trajectory**, the Check Agent reports that the current Subtask has failed to complete. The above is the Check Agent's check report.
Please combine this check report with the current Subtask's historical execution trajectory to analyze the key obstacles currently hindering task completion and develop an actionable plan for the next steps.


17. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================
* The current Subtask still has the following issues:
    1. The content extracted and saved to `bustub_issue_759_instructions.md` was raw accessibility tree data instead of the plain text instructions from the GitLab issue. This indicates a misunderstanding or improper handling of the `browser_extract_content_by_vision` tool's output.
    2. The file `bustub_issue_759_instructions.md` was not uploaded to ownCloud, and consequently, no share link was generated or saved, due to a complete omission of steps involving ownCloud interaction.

* Consider trying the following actions:
    1. Re-extract the content from the GitLab issue page, ensuring to correctly parse the output of `browser_extract_content_by_vision` to isolate and save only the plain text instructions into `bustub_issue_759_instructions.md`.
    2. Access ownCloud using the provided credentials.
    3. Upload the correctly extracted and saved `bustub_issue_759_instructions.md` file to ownCloud.
    4. Generate a public share link for the uploaded file on ownCloud.
    5. Save the generated share link into `sharelink.txt` in the `/workspace/` directory.

HLL relies on a clever hashing mechanism and a compact data structure to provide accurate estimates of unique users while using only a fraction of the memory required by traditional methods. This makes HLL an essential tool in modern database analytics.

HLL provides a probabilistic counting mechanism based on the following parameters:

From the hash value (binary form), **b** bits are extracted, starting from the most significant bit (MSB). The register value is calculated from the extracted bits. (by default each register has a value of 0).

From the remaining set of bits, the position of the leftmost 1 is obtained (MSB), i.e the number of leading zeros from left plus 1 (as given in the picture given below).

Thought: I have successfully extracted a significant portion of the page content. The `browser_extract_content_by_vision` tool provided the text, including the "Instructions" heading. Now I need to programmatically extract the content starting from the "Instructions" section and save it to a markdown file. This addresses the previous issue where the file contained raw accessibility tree data.

Here is the plan:
1.  Store the extracted text in a Python variable.
2.  Find the starting index of the "Instructions" heading.
3.  Slice the text from that index to the end.
4.  Write the sliced text to `/workspace/bustub_issue_759_instructions.md`.

Thought: I have successfully logged in and dismissed the initial overlay. Now I need to locate the `bustub_issue_759_instructions.md` file and click its "Share" link to generate a public share link. Looking at the `webpage interactive elements`, I see the entry for my file: `{"index": 71, "tag": "span", "text": "", "aria-label": "bustub_issue_759_instructions"}` (The link that wraps this is `{"index": 70, "tag": "a", "text": "<a/>", "href": "/remote.php/webdav/bustub_issue_759_instructions.md"}`). The `Share` link associated with it has index `73`.

I will click on the share link with index 73 to open the sharing options.

## Subtask Verification Report

**Title**: Verification of Subtask 1: Navigate to GitLab Issue Page and Extract Instructions to OwnCloud

**Checklist Details**:

1.  **Check 1: Local MD File Content**
    *   **Goal**: Verify that the file `/workspace/bustub_issue_759_instructions.md` exists and its content correctly starts with 'Instructions' and contains all subsequent relevant text from the GitLab issue page.
    *   **Observation (from `cat /workspace/bustub_issue_759_instructions.md`):**
        ```
        ## Instructions
        You will have to complete the two functions part of this project:
        ### Task #1
        The first step is to implement a basic HyperLogLog data structure.
        In hyperloglog.h, following functions have to be implemented:
        *   `HyperLogLog(inital_bits)`: a constructor where a number of leading bits (b) is provided.
        *   `GetCardinality()`: returns the cardinality value of a given set
        *   `AddElem(val)`: computes and places the value in the register.
        *   `ComputeCardinality()`: computes the cardinality based on the above formula.
        Along with it, you can implement helper functions to implement the above (can add more as per requirement):
        *   `ComputeBinary(hash_t hash)`: It computes a binary of a given hash value. The hash value should be converted to a 64 bit binary stream (otherwise tests may fail).
        *   `PositionOfLeftmostOne(....)`: it computes the position of the leftmost 1.
        For calculating hash, you can use the given function:
        *   `CalculateHash(...)` - to calculate hash
        Please refer to the std::bitset library for storing in binary representation. When a value is obtained in decimal, convert into a greatest integer **less than or equal to** the decmial. Refer std::floor for more details.
        ### Task #2
        In the second step, you will implement Presto's dense layout implementation of HLL (Refer to the dense layout section).
        Note: In Presto's implementation, the binary rightmost contiguous set of zeros are counted (instead of the left zero count). In this task, similar approach should be used.
        The HLL stores overflow Buckets in the following manner: if the number of rightmost contiguous zeros are 33, its binary form will be 0100001. In this scenario, it will be split into two pars, first 3 MSBs 010 and the last 4 LSBs 0001. 0001 will be stored in the dense bucket, and the MSB 010 (which are overflowing bits) are stored in overflowing bucket.
        In hyperloglog_presto.h following functions will be used for grading:
        *   `GetDenseBucket()` - Returns the dense bucket array
        *   `GetOverflowBucketOfIdx(..)` - Returns the overflow set of bits for the given index (if it exists).
        *   `GetCardinality()` - Returns the cardinality value
        Do not delete the above functions.
        Implement the following functions:
        *   `HyperLogLogPresto(initial_bits)` - a constructor for HyperLogLogPresto
        *   `AddElem()` - computes and places the value in the register.
        *   `ComputeCardinality()` - computes the cardinality based on the above formula.
        For calculating hash, you can use the given function:
        *   `CalculateHash(...)` - to calculate hash
        When a value is obtained in decimal, convert into a greatest integer **less than or equal to** the decmial.
        ## Important Information
        *   In **Task 2**, convert the hash value into 64-bit binary and then count the contiguous zeros (LSB).
        *   For calculating cardinality in both **Task 1** & **Task 2**, following steps should be followed.
            *   Calculate the sum of the exponents and store it in memory using a `double` variable with default precision (no need for custom precision). The part of the formula to be stored in memory is shown below. Use `std::pow` for calculating the exponents.
            *   Using the sum calculated above, determine the cardinality as shown below.
            *   After obtaining the result above, convert it to the **greatest integer less than or equal to** the value. (as mentioned above).
        Failing to follow the steps above may result in inaccurate outcomes that do not align with the test cases.
        ## Setting Up Your Development Environment
        First install the packages that BusTub requires:
        # Linux $ sudo build_support/packages.sh # macOS $ build_support/packages.sh
        See the README for additional information on how to setup different OS environments.
        To build the system from the commandline, execute the following commands:
        $ mkdir build $ cd build $ cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug .. $ make -j`nproc`
        We recommend always configuring CMake in debug mode. This will enable you to output debug messages and check for memory leaks (more on this in below sections).
        ## Testing
        You can test the individual components of this assignment using our testing framework. We use GTest for unit test cases. You can disable tests in GTest by adding a `DISABLED_` prefix to the test name. To run the tests from the command-line:
        $ cd build $ make -j$(nproc) hyperloglog_test $ ./test/hyperloglog_test
        ```
    *   **Result**: Passed. The file exists and its content correctly starts with "## Instructions" and contains the expected text.

2.  **Check 2: OwnCloud Upload Verification**
    *   **Goal**: Confirm that the `bustub_issue_759_instructions.md` file has been successfully uploaded to the OwnCloud instance.
    *   **Observation (from `curl -u theagentcompany:theagentcompany -X PROPFIND --header "Depth: 1" http://the-agent-company.com:8092/remote.php/webdav/`):** The output XML contains the entry `<D:displayname>bustub_issue_759_instructions.md</D:displayname>`, confirming the file's presence.
    *   **Result**: Passed. The file `bustub_issue_759_instructions.md` is successfully uploaded and listed in OwnCloud via WebDAV.

3.  **Check 3: Share Link File Content**
    *   **Goal**: Verify that the file `/workspace/sharelink.txt` exists and contains a valid URL generated by OwnCloud.
    *   **Observation (from `cat /workspace/sharelink.txt`):**
        ```
        http://the-agent-company.com:8092/index.php/s/KRptnZduo4NXkgM
        ```
    *   **Result**: Passed. The file `sharelink.txt` exists and contains the expected share link.

4.  **Check 4: Public Share Link Accessibility and Content**
    *   **Goal**: Access the URL from `sharelink.txt` and ensure the content displayed matches the expected content of `bustub_issue_759_instructions.md`.
    *   **Steps performed**:
        1.  Navigated to `http://the-agent-company.com:8092/index.php/s/KRptnZduo4NXkgM` using `browser_go_to_url`.
        2.  Extracted content from the loaded page using `browser_extract_content_by_vision` with the query "Extract all visible text content on this page."
        3.  The extracted content clearly displays the instructions from the markdown file. For brevity, not including the entire output, but key sections like "## Instructions", "### Task #1", etc. are present.
    *   **Result**: Passed. The public share link is accessible, and the content displayed matches the extracted instructions.

**Conclusion**:
The current Subtask is **complete**. All specified requirements, including extracting the correct content, saving it locally, uploading it to OwnCloud, generating a share link, and saving the share link, have been successfully met.
