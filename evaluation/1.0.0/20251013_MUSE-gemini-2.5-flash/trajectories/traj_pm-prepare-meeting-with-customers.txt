Returns a JSON object with `execution_status`, `returncode`, `stdout`, and `stderr`. **Important Precautions**: 1) `returncode=0` does not guarantee successful side effects (e.g., file creation); always verify with independent checks (`ls -l`, `file`). 2) **This tool executes commands in a *minimal* shell environment. Complex shell features like command chaining (`&&`, `||`), pipes (`|`), I/O redirection (`>`, `>>`), and backgrounding (`&`) are often *not reliably interpreted by `run_cmd` directly* and can lead to unexpected behavior or errors (e.g., `SyntaxError`, `command not found`). For any non-trivial shell interaction or complex logic, *always prefer consolidating operations into a single Python script that uses `subprocess` for explicit control and robustness* over multiple `run_cmd` calls or complex shell syntax.** 3) Quote arguments containing spaces (`\"path with spaces\"`). 4) State changes (`cd`) do not persist across calls.", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"command": {"type": "string", "description": "shell command string."}}, "required": ["command"]}}}
</tools>

2. **Python Code Execution**
When executing Python code, please output:
<code>
... your code ...
</code>
- The working directory is `/workspace`
- Executing dangerous, destructive, or time-consuming code is prohibited.
- If both a **Tool Call** and **Python Code Execution** are included in the output, the tool call takes precedence, and the Python code will not be executed.
- Using outdated or limited python libraries may result in incomplete or inaccurate observations (e.g. missing images from PDFs or failing to extract key content). Always prefer robust, modern libraries to ensure full and reliable results.
- When performing file conversion or data extraction, always ensure **data integrity**. Verify that the structure, content, and critical fields of the source file are preserved in the output. Check row and column counts, headers, and key values before and after processing. **Avoid silent loss**, truncation, or unintended alteration of data.

## Action Execution Result Processing
- After each action is executed, an Observation is returned, which includes:
    1. `<tool_response>`: The result of the tool or code execution.
    2. `<tool_instruction>`: The instruction associated with a specific action, used to guide the next step or restrict subsequent behavior.
- **Note**: Do not fabricate observations.

## Security and Restrictions
- **Coding Actions (such as Python, CMD, etc.)**
    - Do not run high-risk operations that are large in code size or take a long time.
    - Do not execute code that could cause data loss, system damage, or irreversible changes.
    - Do not use the kill command with wildcards like * or other dangerous parameters that could result in a wide range of matches.
    - Prefer using the Python interpreter to execute code (safer and more efficient) rather than using the CMD tool.

> ⚠️ **Important**
> When your output contains content that fully conforms to the **Tool Call** or **Python Code Execution** format, the system will immediately parse, identify, and execute it as an **Action** without further confirmation and without reversal.
> Therefore, before outputting, always confirm that this is your **intended** action and fully assess the potential consequences and risks.
> If you are only using **quotes, demonstrations, or examples**, be sure to break the formatting or escape it to prevent the system from interpreting it as a real action.

# OBJECTIVE #
Your core objective is to independently and efficiently complete the tasks assigned to you by the company.


# MEMORY #
During previous tasks, you have accumulated the following reusable knowledge:

## Resolution Patterns
Comprehensive Contextualization: Systematically acquire and aggregate information from diverse, potentially unstructured sources, prioritizing local processing and cross-validation, to ensure a complete, coherent operational view and inform robust decisions.
Robust External Interaction: Prioritize stable, predictable interaction methods, such as structured APIs, and dynamically adapt strategies to ensure continuity and reliability with external systems despite their inconsistencies or volatility.
Adaptive Constraint Handling: When an objective is blocked by an unresolvable external constraint, acknowledge the limitation, perform necessary cleanup of partial artifacts, and adapt the strategy to proceed with viable data, avoiding unproductive retries.
Modular Resilient Design: Decompose operations into modular, decoupled units with explicit state management, to enhance predictability, isolate errors, improve maintainability, and ensure operational continuity.
Progressive Verification: Implement multi-stage validation, from granular checks within pipelines to comprehensive outcome validation, to localize errors, confirm system states, and ensure successful execution.

## Platform/Application Operation Guides
These guides summarize proven operation paths derived from past successful experiences.  
Each item is a structured reference designed to help you complete operations more quickly, accurately, and with reduced redundancy.

> This directory provides a comprehensive index of guides, compiling best practices and experience summaries for accomplishing various tasks.

### Recommended Usage Process
1. **Review the Guide First**  
   Before starting a task, browse the relevant entries in the directory to identify potentially useful guidance.  
2. **Targeted Access**  
   Use the `access_the_application_guide` tool to view detailed steps if necessary.  
3. **Reuse with Flexibility**  
   Apply past successful steps when they fit the current situation, but stay aware of possible mismatches.  
4. **Explore When Deviations Arise**  
   If the environment or results diverge from the guide, stop rigidly following it and explore alternative approaches through small, safe, and adaptive steps.

### Value of Guides
- Reduce task completion time by leveraging accumulated experience.  
- Lower error rates and avoid common pitfalls.  
- Ensure consistent, professional execution of tasks.  

### Guide Reliability & Adaptation
- Guides may be outdated, biased, or contain errors — they are “historical experience,” not absolute truth.  
- Use guides as starting points, not as strict rules.  
- When deviations or conflicts appear, **exit the guide and explore new paths** instead of persisting.  
- Record useful deviation points for later improvement of the guides.

## Verification Report for SubTask 1

### Title: Verification of OpenHands GitLab Repository Exploration

### Checklist Details:

*   **Verify_Repository_Cloned**: The OpenHands repository has been successfully cloned to `/workspace/openhands`. This was confirmed by the `git clone` command's `returncode: 0` in Observation 23 and the subsequent successful listing of its contents by `ls -F /workspace/openhands` in Observation 25.
*   **Verify_Benchmark_File_Exists**: The file `/workspace/openhands/evaluation/README.md` exists. This was confirmed by the output of `ls -F /workspace/openhands/evaluation` in Observation 31, which explicitly listed `README.md` among the directory's contents.
*   **Verify_Benchmark_File_Content**: The content of `/workspace/openhands/evaluation/README.md`, as shown in Observation 33, indeed lists and categorizes OpenHands benchmarks. It includes sections like "Software Engineering", "Web Browsing", and "Misc. Assistance", each containing a list of relevant benchmarks, thus fulfilling the requirement to identify files related to benchmarks or capabilities.

### Conclusion:
The Task Agent has successfully completed SubTask 1: "Explore OpenHands GitLab repository". The repository was cloned, and the relevant file containing benchmark information has been identified and verified.

The script extracted the categories and benchmarks, but it also included "Result Visualization" and "Upload your results" as categories with empty lists, which are not actual benchmark categories. I need to refine the parsing logic to only include the relevant benchmark categories.

The goal of this subtask is to programmatically extract and store the categorized list of benchmarks. The current output is a dictionary, which is a good way to store the data. I just need to clean up the dictionary by removing the irrelevant entries.

I will modify the Python script to filter out categories that do not contain any benchmarks or are not actual benchmark categories.

## Verification Report for SubTask 2

### Title: Verification of Benchmark Extraction and Processing

### Checklist Details:

*   **Verify_Output_Structure**: The final output from the Task Agent's execution is confirmed to be a Python dictionary, indicating successful programmatic storage. This is evidenced by the `stdout` in `Observation 7` and explicitly stated by the Task Agent in `Observation 8`.
*   **Verify_Extracted_Categories**: The extracted dictionary contains only the intended benchmark categories: 'Software Engineering', 'Web Browsing', and 'Misc. Assistance'. No extraneous categories are present, as verified by the keys in the dictionary output in `Observation 7`.
*   **Verify_Benchmarks_Per_Category**: For each valid category, the list of extracted benchmarks precisely matches the content of the original 'README.md' file provided within the Task Agent's Python script (`Observation 4` and `Observation 6`). All benchmarks were correctly identified, and none were missing or incorrectly added, confirmed by comparing the content in `Observation 7` with the `readme_content`.
*   **Confirm_Irrelevant_Category_Exclusion**: Categories identified as irrelevant during the parsing process ('Result Visualization', 'Upload your results') are not present in the final extracted dictionary. This confirms the Task Agent's successful self-correction in `Observation 6`, which is reflected in the final output in `Observation 7`.

### Conclusion:
The Task Agent has successfully completed SubTask 2: "Extract and Process Benchmarks". It has programmatically extracted and stored the categorized list of benchmarks from `/workspace/openhands/evaluation/README.md`, accurately identifying all relevant benchmarks and their categories while correctly excluding irrelevant sections. The final output is a clean and correctly structured Python dictionary containing the required information.

## Verification Report for SubTask 3

### Title: Verification of Presentation Slide Deck Generation

### Checklist Details:

*   **Verify_Presentation_File_Existence**: The presentation file `/workspace/openhands_intro.pptx` was successfully created. This was confirmed by executing `run_cmd("ls /workspace/openhands_intro.pptx")`, which returned `returncode: 0` and `stdout: /workspace/openhands_intro.pptx`.
*   **Verify_Presentation_File_Type**: The created file is indeed a valid PowerPoint presentation. This was verified by `run_cmd("file /workspace/openhands_intro.pptx")`, which identified the file as `Microsoft OOXML` (the format for .pptx files), with `returncode: 0` and `stdout: /workspace/openhands_intro.pptx: Microsoft OOXML`.
*   **Verify_Presentation_Content_Structure**: The internal structure and content of the presentation match the requirements. A programmatic check using `pptx` library confirmed the presence of a title slide with the expected text ("OpenHands Agent Capabilities" and "Benchmarks Solved by OpenHands Agents"), followed by three separate slides titled "Software Engineering", "Web Browsing", and "Misc. Assistance". Each category slide correctly listed its respective benchmarks as per the `benchmarks` data provided to the Task Agent. The Python verification script executed successfully, returning `returncode: 0` and `stdout: "Presentation structure and content verified successfully."`.

### Conclusion:
The Task Agent has successfully completed SubTask 3: "Generate Presentation Slide Deck". The PowerPoint presentation file `/workspace/openhands_intro.pptx` has been created, is of the correct file type, and its content structure (title slide, category slides, and benchmark listings) meets all specified requirements.

## Verification Report for SubTask 4

### Title: Verification of RocketChat Notification to Project Manager

### Checklist Details:

*   **Verify_Recipient_Page**: The Task Agent successfully navigated to the direct message conversation with 'huang_jie'. This is confirmed by the URL `http://the-agent-company.com:3000/direct/CZYWHd5bCmhj5YcFeTAh4ug5jgz97QthJ2` and the page heading `heading 'huang_jie', level=1` found in Observation 17.
*   **Verify_Message_Content_In_Chat**: The exact message "Hi Huang Jie, the presentation slide deck 'openhands_intro.pptx' is ready and saved in /workspace/openhands_intro.pptx. Please let me know if you need anything else." is visibly present in the chat history within the `paragraph` element of the `webpage accessibility tree` in Observation 21. This confirms that the intended message content was delivered.
*   **Verify_Sender_Displayed**: The `webpage accessibility tree` in Observation 21 explicitly shows `StaticText 'theagentcompany'` directly preceding the message content. This confirms that the message was posted from the correct account.

### Conclusion:
The Task Agent has successfully completed SubTask 4: "Send Notification to Project Manager". The RocketChat message containing the filename `/workspace/openhands_intro.pptx` was sent to Huang Jie from the correct account, confirming the presentation slide deck is ready.
