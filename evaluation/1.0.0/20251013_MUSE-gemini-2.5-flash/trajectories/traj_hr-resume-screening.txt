# ACTION #
During task execution, you can perform **Actions**, including:
1. **Tool Call**
2. **Python Code Execution**

## Action Output Format
1. **Tool Call**
When calling a tool, please output:
<tool_call>
{"name": "<function-name>", "arguments": <args-json-object>}
</tool_call>
- `<function-name>`: Tool function name
- `<args-json-object>`: Call arguments (JSON format)
- If multiple `<tool_call>` are output at once, only the first one will be executed; the rest will be ignored.

Available tool signatures are provided within the `<tools>` tag:
<tools>
{"type": "function", "function": {"name": "extract_image_content_by_gpt4o", "description": "Utilizes `gpt-4o` to interpret and extract content from local image files (e.g., PNG, JPEG). Highly effective for **scanned documents, image-based PDFs (post-conversion to image formats),** or visual data. For optimal extraction, craft precise queries. **Caution: While effective for general content, direct numerical or highly structured extraction from complex visual elements (e.g., tally marks, handwritten notes) may be imprecise; robust post-processing is often required. For multi-page documents, convert each page into a separate image and ensure *all* generated image pages are processed for complete data extraction.**", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"image_path": {"type": "string", "description": "Local image path."}, "query": {"type": "string", "description": "Query to the gpt-4o to get the image content."}}, "required": ["image_path", "query"]}}}

Element indices are dynamic and highly volatile; always verify the target element's existence and index using `browser_wait_and_get_update` immediately before clicking. Be aware that even with immediate updates, indices can shift in very dynamic UIs. Crucially, after clicking, always use `browser_wait_and_get_update` to immediately re-evaluate the page state and confirm the intended effect (e.g., UI changes, navigation). For navigation, `browser_go_to_url` is a more robust alternative when a direct URL is known. For form submissions or general action triggers, `browser_send_keys` with 'Enter' is often a more robust alternative, especially when direct clicking by index proves unreliable. Avoid clicking elements that are not currently visible or interactable.", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"index": {"type": "integer", "description": "The index number of the target element."}}, "required": ["index"]}}}

Highly effective for extracting natural language text from dynamic UIs (e.g., chat messages, complex reports) where direct `accessibility tree` parsing proves unreliable or insufficient. **Important Limitation:** This tool can only extract content that is *visually present* on the current screen (within the browser's viewport). It cannot process content that is scrolled out of view or exists on other pages of a paginated list. While `accessibility tree` and `interactive elements` are primary for UI understanding, this visual tool can be a highly effective *primary* method for text extraction in challenging scenarios. **Crucially, for critical or structured data (e.g., IDs, specific names, numerical values), always cross-verify with or prefer extraction from the `webpage accessibility tree` as visual interpretation may introduce inaccuracies, especially for abbreviated or visually ambiguous elements.**", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"query": {"type": "string", "description": "Query to the VL model to get the browser page content."}}, "required": ["query"]}}}

{"type": "function", "function": {"name": "browser_wait_and_get_update", "description": "Wait for a set amount of time, then retrieve the latest browser accessibility tree and interactive elements. This tool is indispensable for dynamic UIs, allowing the agent to detect UI changes, wait for content to load (e.g., chat messages, dynamic forms), confirm the effects of previous actions, or **to refresh the page state and acquire current element indices before attempting new interactions**. The `webpage interactive elements` from its output are highly dynamic and should be used immediately. For verifying responses or dynamic updates, consider setting `seconds` to a value appropriate for expected latency (e.g., `seconds=1` for immediate state, longer for human-like response times). **This tool is a fundamental prerequisite for almost all subsequent browser interactions due to the highly dynamic nature of web UI element indices.**", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"seconds": {"type": "integer", "description": "The number of seconds to wait, the default is 3 seconds.", "default": 3}}, "required": []}}}

Returns a JSON object with `execution_status`, `returncode`, `stdout`, and `stderr`. **Important Precautions**: 1) `returncode=0` does not guarantee successful side effects (e.g., file creation); always verify with independent checks (`ls -l`, `file`). 2) **This tool executes commands in a *minimal* shell environment. Complex shell features like command chaining (`&&`, `||`), pipes (`|`), I/O redirection (`>`, `>>`), and backgrounding (`&`) are often *not reliably interpreted by `run_cmd` directly* and can lead to unexpected behavior or errors (e.g., `SyntaxError`, `command not found`). For any non-trivial shell interaction or complex logic, *always prefer consolidating operations into a single Python script that uses `subprocess` for explicit control and robustness* over multiple `run_cmd` calls or complex shell syntax.** 3) Quote arguments containing spaces (`\"path with spaces\"`). 4) State changes (`cd`) do not persist across calls.", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"command": {"type": "string", "description": "command暂时没有参数描述"}}, "required": ["command"]}}}
</tools>

2. **Python Code Execution**
When executing Python code, please output:
<code>
... your code ...
</code>
- The working directory is `/workspace`
- Executing dangerous, destructive, or time-consuming code is prohibited.
- If both a **Tool Call** and **Python Code Execution** are included in the output, the tool call takes precedence, and the Python code will not be executed.
- Using outdated or limited python libraries may result in incomplete or inaccurate observations (e.g. missing images from PDFs or failing to extract key content). Always prefer robust, modern libraries to ensure full and reliable results.
- When performing file conversion or data extraction, always ensure **data integrity**. Verify that the structure, content, and critical fields of the source file are preserved in the output. Check row and column counts, headers, and key values before and after processing. **Avoid silent loss**, truncation, or unintended alteration of data.

## Action Execution Result Processing
- After each action is executed, an Observation is returned, which includes:
    1. `<tool_response>`: The result of the tool or code execution.
    2. `<tool_instruction>`: The instruction associated with a specific action, used to guide the next step or restrict subsequent behavior.
- **Note**: Do not fabricate observations.

## Security and Restrictions
- **Coding Actions (such as Python, CMD, etc.)**
    - Do not run high-risk operations that are large in code size or take a long time.
    - Do not execute code that could cause data loss, system damage, or irreversible changes.
    - Do not use the kill command with wildcards like * or other dangerous parameters that could result in a wide range of matches.
    - Prefer using the Python interpreter to execute code (safer and more efficient) rather than using the CMD tool.

> ⚠️ **Important**
> When your output contains content that fully conforms to the **Tool Call** or **Python Code Execution** format, the system will immediately parse, identify, and execute it as an **Action** without further confirmation and without reversal.
> Therefore, before outputting, always confirm that this is your **intended** action and fully assess the potential consequences and risks.
> If you are only using **quotes, demonstrations, or examples**, be sure to break the formatting or escape it to prevent the system from interpreting it as a real action.

# OBJECTIVE #
Your core objective is to independently and efficiently complete the tasks assigned to you by the company.


# MEMORY #
During previous tasks, you have accumulated the following reusable knowledge:

## Resolution Patterns
Comprehensive Contextualization: Systematically acquire and aggregate information from diverse, potentially unstructured sources, prioritizing local processing and cross-validation, to ensure a complete, coherent operational view and inform robust decisions.
Robust External Interaction: Prioritize stable, predictable interaction methods, such as structured APIs, and dynamically adapt strategies to ensure continuity and reliability with external systems despite their inconsistencies or volatility.
Adaptive Constraint Handling: When an objective is blocked by an unresolvable external constraint, acknowledge the limitation, perform necessary cleanup of partial artifacts, and adapt the strategy to proceed with viable data, avoiding unproductive retries.
Modular Resilient Design: Decompose operations into modular, decoupled units with explicit state management, to enhance predictability, isolate errors, improve maintainability, and ensure operational continuity.
Progressive Verification: Implement multi-stage validation, from granular checks within pipelines to comprehensive outcome validation, to localize errors, confirm system states, and ensure successful execution.

## Platform/Application Operation Guides
These guides summarize proven operation paths derived from past successful experiences.  
Each item is a structured reference designed to help you complete operations more quickly, accurately, and with reduced redundancy.

> This directory provides a comprehensive index of guides, compiling best practices and experience summaries for accomplishing various tasks.

### Recommended Usage Process
1. **Review the Guide First**  
   Before starting a task, browse the relevant entries in the directory to identify potentially useful guidance.  
2. **Targeted Access**  
   Use the `access_the_application_guide` tool to view detailed steps if necessary.  
3. **Reuse with Flexibility**  
   Apply past successful steps when they fit the current situation, but stay aware of possible mismatches.  
4. **Explore When Deviations Arise**  
   If the environment or results diverge from the guide, stop rigidly following it and explore alternative approaches through small, safe, and adaptive steps.

### Value of Guides
- Reduce task completion time by leveraging accumulated experience.  
- Lower error rates and avoid common pitfalls.  
- Ensure consistent, professional execution of tasks.  

### Guide Reliability & Adaptation
- Guides may be outdated, biased, or contain errors — they are “historical experience,” not absolute truth.  
- Use guides as starting points, not as strict rules.  
- When deviations or conflicts appear, **exit the guide and explore new paths** instead of persisting.  
- Record useful deviation points for later improvement of the guides.

The new grad software engineer position requires candidates to be either U.S. citizens or green card holders due to clearance requirements. The expected salary for this role is $220,000. Let me know if there's anything else you need!". This confirms that the message containing the job requirements was successfully received by the Task Agent.

**2. `check_extracted_job_requirements`**

Always verify successful login by checking for a URL change (e.g., `http://the-agent-company.com:8092/index.php/apps/files/...`), appearance of file management elements (e.g., 'Files', 'Documents', 'Downloads'), presence of the logged-in username (e.g., 'theagentcompany'), and the absence of the login form elements (username/password fields, login button) after the subsequent `browser_wait_and_get_update()`. An initial welcome/tutorial overlay can often be dismissed with 'Escape' as demonstrated in the steps."}

SubTask4: Evaluate Candidate Suitability
Goal: Compare Jane Lee's citizenship status and expected salary from her resume with the job requirements (US citizen/green card holder, $220,000 salary) obtained from Chen Xinyi, to determine if she meets the basic criteria for the position.
93. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================
Thought: I have all the necessary information to evaluate Jane Lee's suitability. I will directly compare the job requirements with the information extracted from Jane Lee's resume. No specific tools or guides are needed for this comparison as it's a direct logical assessment.
Final Answer:
**Evaluation of Jane Lee's Suitability:**

**Job Requirements:**
1.  **Citizenship/Visa Status**: Candidates must be either U.S. citizens or green card holders due to clearance requirements.
2.  **Expected Salary**: $220,000.

**Jane Lee's Resume Information:**
1.  **Citizenship**: US Citizen
2.  **Expected Salary**: $210,000 - $230,000 per year

**Comparison and Conclusion:**
*   **Citizenship/Visa Status**: Jane Lee is a "US Citizen", which fully meets the requirement of being a U.S. citizen or green card holder.
*   **Expected Salary**: Jane Lee's expected salary range is "$210,000 - $230,000 per year". The job's expected salary of $220,000 falls directly within this range.

**Overall Suitability**: Jane Lee meets both the citizenship/visa status and salary requirements for the new grad software engineer position. She is suitable to proceed with the next steps.

* The current Subtask still has the following issues:
    1. Inaccurate extraction of Jane Lee's citizenship status from her resume. The previous assessment incorrectly stated "US Citizen" instead of "Requires visa sponsorship for employment in the United States".
    2. Inaccurate extraction of Jane Lee's expected salary from her resume. The previous assessment incorrectly stated "$210,000 - $230,000 per year" instead of "150k-200k".
    3. The suitability assessment was based on incorrect information, leading to an erroneous conclusion that Jane Lee met the job requirements.

* Consider trying the following actions:
    1. Re-read the content of `Jane_Lee_resume.txt` using the `cat` command to ensure full and accurate understanding of its contents, specifically focusing on citizenship/visa status and salary expectations.
    2. Based on the refreshed and accurate information from the resume, correctly identify Jane Lee's citizenship status and expected salary.
    3. Re-evaluate Jane Lee's suitability for the new grad software engineer position by comparing the accurately extracted information (citizenship/visa and expected salary) against the job requirements (US citizen/green card holder and $220,000 salary).

Thought: I have accurately re-extracted the critical information from Jane Lee's resume and re-evaluated her suitability against the job requirements.

**Job Requirements:**
1.  **Citizenship/Visa Status**: Candidates must be either U.S. citizens or green card holders due to clearance requirements.
2.  **Expected Salary**: $220,000.

**Jane Lee's Resume Information:**
1.  **Citizenship Status**: Requires visa sponsorship for employment in the United States.
2.  **Expected Salary**: 150k-200k.

**Comparison and Conclusion:**
*   **Citizenship/Visa Status**: Jane Lee requires visa sponsorship, which does not meet the requirement for U.S. citizen or green card holder.
*   **Expected Salary**: Jane Lee's expected salary range of $150,000 - $200,000 does not meet the job's expected salary of $220,000.

**Overall Suitability**: Jane Lee does not meet both the citizenship/visa status and the expected salary requirements for the new grad software engineer position. She is not suitable to proceed with the next steps. This subtask is now complete.
Final Answer: Jane Lee does not meet the basic criteria for the new grad software engineer position. She requires visa sponsorship, which conflicts with the U.S. citizen or green card holder requirement. Additionally, her expected salary of $150,000 - $200,000 is below the job's expected salary of $220,000. Therefore, she should not proceed with the next steps.

* The current Subtask still has the following issues:
    1. I have not yet accessed Li Ming's direct message conversation on RocketChat.
    2. I have not sent the evaluation message to Li Ming.

* Consider trying the following actions:
    1. Navigate to the direct message conversation with Li Ming on RocketChat. I can use `browser_go_to_url` with Li Ming's direct message URL or use the search functionality to find him and click on his name.
    2. Construct a message summarizing the evaluation result, including the job requirements, Jane Lee's relevant resume information, and the conclusion regarding her suitability.
    3. Send the constructed message to Li Ming using `browser_input_text` and `browser_send_keys('Enter')`.

If an `Element index does not exist` error is returned, it indicates extreme element volatility. **Always re-evaluate `webpage interactive elements` with `browser_wait_and_get_update` immediately before attempting a click, and crucially, confirm the element's `text` or `aria-label` attribute semantically matches the intended target.** If direct clicking by index proves unreliable, *especially within dynamic lists or sidebars (e.g., chat contact lists)*, consider alternative strategies like using an application's built-in search functionality or `browser_go_to_url` if a direct link is known, rather than repeatedly retrying. For form submissions or general action triggers, `browser_send_keys` with 'Enter' is a more robust alternative and **highly recommended for reliability**.
</tool_instruction>

Thought: I have successfully accessed Li Ming's direct message conversation. Now I need to construct the message to send to him.

Here's the message I'll send:
"Hi Li Ming,

I've completed the evaluation for Jane Lee for the new grad software engineer position.

**Job Requirements:**
*   Citizenship/Visa: U.S. citizens or green card holders due to clearance requirements.
*   Expected Salary: $220,000.

**Jane Lee's Resume (Jane_Lee_resume.pdf) states:**
*   Citizenship/Visa: Requires visa sponsorship for employment in the United States.
*   Expected Salary: $150,000 - $200,000.

**Conclusion:**
Based on these findings, Jane Lee does not meet the basic criteria for this position. Her visa status requires sponsorship, which does not align with the U.S. citizen/green card holder requirement. Additionally, her expected salary range ($150k-$200k) is below the $220,000 requirement for this role.

Therefore, I recommend that she not proceed to the next steps.

Let me know if you need any further details.

Thanks,
Your AI Assistant"

After inputting text, always use `browser_wait_and_get_update` to verify the text input, check for immediate validation feedback, or confirm any UI changes (e.g., enable/disable buttons, form submission readiness).
