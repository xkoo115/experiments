# ACTION #
During task execution, you can perform **Actions**, including:
1. **Tool Call**
2. **Python Code Execution**

## Action Output Format
1. **Tool Call**
When calling a tool, please output:
<tool_call>
{"name": "<function-name>", "arguments": <args-json-object>}
</tool_call>
- `<function-name>`: Tool function name
- `<args-json-object>`: Call arguments (JSON format)
- If multiple `<tool_call>` are output at once, only the first one will be executed; the rest will be ignored.

Available tool signatures are provided within the `<tools>` tag:
<tools>
{"type": "function", "function": {"name": "extract_image_content_by_gpt4o", "description": "Utilizes `gpt-4o` to interpret and extract content from local image files (e.g., PNG, JPEG). Highly effective for **scanned documents, image-based PDFs (post-conversion to image formats),** or visual data. For optimal extraction, craft precise queries. **Caution: While effective for general content, direct numerical or highly structured extraction from complex visual elements (e.g., tally marks, handwritten notes) may be imprecise; robust post-processing is often required. For multi-page documents, convert each page into a separate image and ensure *all* generated image pages are processed for complete data extraction.**", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"image_path": {"type": "string", "description": "Local image path."}, "query": {"type": "string", "description": "Query to the gpt-4o to get the image content."}}, "required": ["image_path", "query"]}}}

Element indices are dynamic and highly volatile; always verify the target element's existence and index using `browser_wait_and_get_update` immediately before clicking. Be aware that even with immediate updates, indices can shift in very dynamic UIs. Crucially, after clicking, always use `browser_wait_and_get_update` to immediately re-evaluate the page state and confirm the intended effect (e.g., UI changes, navigation). For navigation, `browser_go_to_url` is a more robust alternative when a direct URL is known. For form submissions or general action triggers, `browser_send_keys` with 'Enter' is often a more robust alternative, especially when direct clicking by index proves unreliable. Avoid clicking elements that are not currently visible or interactable.", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"index": {"type": "integer", "description": "The index number of the target element."}}, "required": ["index"]}}}

Highly effective for extracting natural language text from dynamic UIs (e.g., chat messages, complex reports) where direct `accessibility tree` parsing proves unreliable or insufficient. **Important Limitation:** This tool can only extract content that is *visually present* on the current screen (within the browser's viewport). It cannot process content that is scrolled out of view or exists on other pages of a paginated list. While `accessibility tree` and `interactive elements` are primary for UI understanding, this visual tool can be a highly effective *primary* method for text extraction in challenging scenarios. **Crucially, for critical or structured data (e.g., IDs, specific names, numerical values), always cross-verify with or prefer extraction from the `webpage accessibility tree` as visual interpretation may introduce inaccuracies, especially for abbreviated or visually ambiguous elements.**", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"query": {"type": "string", "description": "Query to the VL model to get the browser page content."}}, "required": ["query"]}}}

If the provided `index` does not correspond to a scrollable container, the tool will default to scrolling the entire page. Useful for navigating content that extends beyond the current viewport. **Note: For comprehensively extracting data from dynamically loading lists (e.g., project lists, search results), repeated scrolling combined with UI element extraction can be unreliable.

It serves as a robust alternative for form submission, action triggering, *or selecting items from dynamic search results/dropdowns* when direct element clicks prove unreliable. This tool interacts with the active window, not a specific element. **This is the most reliable method for form submissions and critical action triggers where `browser_click` on a button might be unreliable due to dynamic UI.**", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"keys": {"type": "string", "description": "The key to sent, such as \"Enter\", \"Control+A\", etc."}}, "required": ["keys"]}}}

{"type": "function", "function": {"name": "browser_wait_and_get_update", "description": "Wait for a set amount of time, then retrieve the latest browser accessibility tree and interactive elements. This tool is indispensable for dynamic UIs, allowing the agent to detect UI changes, wait for content to load (e.g., chat messages, dynamic forms), confirm the effects of previous actions, or **to refresh the page state and acquire current element indices before attempting new interactions**. The `webpage interactive elements` from its output are highly dynamic and should be used immediately. For verifying responses or dynamic updates, consider setting `seconds` to a value appropriate for expected latency (e.g., `seconds=1` for immediate state, longer for human-like response times). **This tool is a fundamental prerequisite for almost all subsequent browser interactions due to the highly dynamic nature of web UI element indices.**", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"seconds": {"type": "integer", "description": "The number of seconds to wait, the default is 3 seconds.", "default": 3}}, "required": []}}}

Returns a JSON object with `execution_status`, `returncode`, `stdout`, and `stderr`. **Important Precautions**: 1) `returncode=0` does not guarantee successful side effects (e.g., file creation); always verify with independent checks (`ls -l`, `file`). 2) **This tool executes commands in a *minimal* shell environment. Complex shell features like command chaining (`&&`, `||`), pipes (`|`), I/O redirection (`>`, `>>`), and backgrounding (`&`) are often *not reliably interpreted by `run_cmd` directly* and can lead to unexpected behavior or errors (e.g., `SyntaxError`, `command not found`). For any non-trivial shell interaction or complex logic, *always prefer consolidating operations into a single Python script that uses `subprocess` for explicit control and robustness* over multiple `run_cmd` calls or complex shell syntax.** 3) Quote arguments containing spaces (`\"path with spaces\"`). 4) State changes (`cd`) do not persist across calls.", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"command": {"type": "string", "description": "command暂时没有参数描述"}}, "required": ["command"]}}}
</tools>

2. **Python Code Execution**
When executing Python code, please output:
<code>
... your code ...
</code>
- The working directory is `/workspace`
- Executing dangerous, destructive, or time-consuming code is prohibited.
- If both a **Tool Call** and **Python Code Execution** are included in the output, the tool call takes precedence, and the Python code will not be executed.
- Using outdated or limited python libraries may result in incomplete or inaccurate observations (e.g. missing images from PDFs or failing to extract key content). Always prefer robust, modern libraries to ensure full and reliable results.
- When performing file conversion or data extraction, always ensure **data integrity**. Verify that the structure, content, and critical fields of the source file are preserved in the output. Check row and column counts, headers, and key values before and after processing. **Avoid silent loss**, truncation, or unintended alteration of data.

## Action Execution Result Processing
- After each action is executed, an Observation is returned, which includes:
    1. `<tool_response>`: The result of the tool or code execution.
    2. `<tool_instruction>`: The instruction associated with a specific action, used to guide the next step or restrict subsequent behavior.
- **Note**: Do not fabricate observations.

## Security and Restrictions
- **Coding Actions (such as Python, CMD, etc.)**
    - Do not run high-risk operations that are large in code size or take a long time.
    - Do not execute code that could cause data loss, system damage, or irreversible changes.
    - Do not use the kill command with wildcards like * or other dangerous parameters that could result in a wide range of matches.
    - Prefer using the Python interpreter to execute code (safer and more efficient) rather than using the CMD tool.

> ⚠️ **Important**
> When your output contains content that fully conforms to the **Tool Call** or **Python Code Execution** format, the system will immediately parse, identify, and execute it as an **Action** without further confirmation and without reversal.
> Therefore, before outputting, always confirm that this is your **intended** action and fully assess the potential consequences and risks.
> If you are only using **quotes, demonstrations, or examples**, be sure to break the formatting or escape it to prevent the system from interpreting it as a real action.

# OBJECTIVE #
Your core objective is to independently and efficiently complete the tasks assigned to you by the company.


# MEMORY #
During previous tasks, you have accumulated the following reusable knowledge:

## Resolution Patterns
Comprehensive Contextualization: Systematically acquire and aggregate information from diverse, potentially unstructured sources, prioritizing local processing and cross-validation, to ensure a complete, coherent operational view and inform robust decisions.
Robust External Interaction: Prioritize stable, predictable interaction methods, such as structured APIs, and dynamically adapt strategies to ensure continuity and reliability with external systems despite their inconsistencies or volatility.
Adaptive Constraint Handling: When an objective is blocked by an unresolvable external constraint, acknowledge the limitation, perform necessary cleanup of partial artifacts, and adapt the strategy to proceed with viable data, avoiding unproductive retries.
Modular Resilient Design: Decompose operations into modular, decoupled units with explicit state management, to enhance predictability, isolate errors, improve maintainability, and ensure operational continuity.
Progressive Verification: Implement multi-stage validation, from granular checks within pipelines to comprehensive outcome validation, to localize errors, confirm system states, and ensure successful execution.

## Platform/Application Operation Guides
These guides summarize proven operation paths derived from past successful experiences.  
Each item is a structured reference designed to help you complete operations more quickly, accurately, and with reduced redundancy.

> This directory provides a comprehensive index of guides, compiling best practices and experience summaries for accomplishing various tasks.

### Recommended Usage Process
1. **Review the Guide First**  
   Before starting a task, browse the relevant entries in the directory to identify potentially useful guidance.  
2. **Targeted Access**  
   Use the `access_the_application_guide` tool to view detailed steps if necessary.  
3. **Reuse with Flexibility**  
   Apply past successful steps when they fit the current situation, but stay aware of possible mismatches.  
4. **Explore When Deviations Arise**  
   If the environment or results diverge from the guide, stop rigidly following it and explore alternative approaches through small, safe, and adaptive steps.

### Value of Guides
- Reduce task completion time by leveraging accumulated experience.  
- Lower error rates and avoid common pitfalls.  
- Ensure consistent, professional execution of tasks.  

### Guide Reliability & Adaptation
- Guides may be outdated, biased, or contain errors — they are “historical experience,” not absolute truth.  
- Use guides as starting points, not as strict rules.  
- When deviations or conflicts appear, **exit the guide and explore new paths** instead of persisting.  
- Record useful deviation points for later improvement of the guides.

If an `Element index does not exist` error is returned, it indicates extreme element volatility. **Always re-evaluate `webpage interactive elements` with `browser_wait_and_get_update` immediately before attempting a click, and crucially, confirm the element's `text` or `aria-label` attribute semantically matches the intended target.** If direct clicking by index proves unreliable, *especially within dynamic lists or sidebars (e.g., chat contact lists)*, consider alternative strategies like using an application's built-in search functionality or `browser_go_to_url` if a direct link is known, rather than repeatedly retrying. For form submissions or general action triggers, `browser_send_keys` with 'Enter' is a more robust alternative and **highly recommended for reliability**.

75. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================
Thought: I have successfully accessed the OwnCloud guides. The `UploadFileWebDAV` guide provides a `curl` command for direct file upload, which is ideal as it bypasses UI interaction and is generally more reliable for file transfers.

I will use the `curl` command to upload `job_description.md` to the `Documents` directory on OwnCloud.

The parameters needed are:
- `username`: `theagentcompany`
- `password`: `theagentcompany`
- `local_file_path`: `/workspace/job_description.md`
- `remote_directory_path`: `Documents`
- `filename`: `job_description.md`

The command will be:

Always check `command_result.returncode`: `0` indicates success; non-zero suggests an error; analyze `command_result.stderr`. For successful commands, process `command_result.stdout`. *Note: `command_result.stderr` may contain non-error information; evaluate contextually.* **Crucially, for any sequence of shell commands or when integrating shell output with Python logic, *always encapsulate the entire interaction within a single Python script using `subprocess`* for maximum robustness and control, rather than relying on discrete `run_cmd` calls or shell features like redirection.**

Thought: The `curl` command executed successfully with `returncode: 0`. The `stderr` contains progress information from `curl` which is normal, and the `stdout` is empty, which is expected for a successful upload. This indicates that the `job_description.md` file has been successfully uploaded to the `Documents` directory on OwnCloud. This completes the subtask.

Title: Subtask 5 Completion Verification Report - Upload Job Description to OwnCloud

Checklist Details:
-   **Verification of cURL Command Execution Status**: The Task Agent's execution of the `curl` command (Observation 5 in the Task Agent's trajectory) showed a `command_result.returncode: 0`. This confirms that the `curl --upload-file` command itself executed without any immediate system-level errors. The `stderr` contained only expected progress information, and `stdout` was empty, which is normal for a successful file upload.
-   **Verification of Remote File Presence on OwnCloud**: A proactive `curl -X PROPFIND` command was executed on the OwnCloud WebDAV server for the `Documents` directory. The `stdout` from this command contained an XML response that explicitly listed `<d:href>/remote.php/webdav/Documents/job_description.md</d:href>`, confirming the successful presence of the `job_description.md` file within the 'Documents' directory on OwnCloud. The `returncode` for this `PROPFIND` command was `0`, indicating a successful query.

Conclusion:
The Subtask "Upload Job Description to OwnCloud" is successfully completed. The `job_description.md` file was successfully uploaded to the 'Documents' directory on OwnCloud, as confirmed by both the Task Agent's successful upload command execution and the proactive verification of the file's presence on the OwnCloud server.

Title: Subtask 6 Completion Verification Report - Create Public Share Link

Checklist Details:
-   **Verification of UI State After Link Generation**: The `webpage accessibility tree` in Observation 25 clearly showed a `textbox` element containing the generated public URL (`http://the-agent-company.com:8092/index.php/s/fnp9Yjn5SXxLWev`), confirming that the link was successfully generated and displayed within the OwnCloud UI.
-   **Validation of Extracted URL Accuracy**: The URL extracted by the Task Agent in its "Final Answer" (Observation 26), `http://the-agent-company.com:8092/index.php/s/fnp9Yjn5SXxLWev`, is identical to the URL found in the `webpage accessibility tree` in Observation 25. This confirms the accuracy of the extracted information.
-   **Verification of Public Accessibility of the Link**: A proactive `curl` command was executed on the extracted public URL, which returned an HTTP status code of `200` in Observation 2. This unequivocally verifies that the generated link is externally accessible and fully functional.

Conclusion:
The Subtask "Create Public Share Link" is successfully completed. The Task Agent successfully navigated the OwnCloud interface, generated a public share link for the `job_description.md` file, accurately extracted the link, and the link was confirmed to be publicly accessible.
