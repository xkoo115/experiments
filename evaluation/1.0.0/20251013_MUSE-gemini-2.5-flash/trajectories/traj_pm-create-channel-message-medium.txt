Returns a JSON object with `execution_status`, `returncode`, `stdout`, and `stderr`. **Important Precautions**: 1) `returncode=0` does not guarantee successful side effects (e.g., file creation); always verify with independent checks (`ls -l`, `file`). 2) **This tool executes commands in a *minimal* shell environment. Complex shell features like command chaining (`&&`, `||`), pipes (`|`), I/O redirection (`>`, `>>`), and backgrounding (`&`) are often *not reliably interpreted by `run_cmd` directly* and can lead to unexpected behavior or errors (e.g., `SyntaxError`, `command not found`). For any non-trivial shell interaction or complex logic, *always prefer consolidating operations into a single Python script that uses `subprocess` for explicit control and robustness* over multiple `run_cmd` calls or complex shell syntax.** 3) Quote arguments containing spaces (`\"path with spaces\"`). 4) State changes (`cd`) do not persist across calls.", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"command": {"type": "string", "description": "command暂时没有参数描述"}}, "required": ["command"]}}}
</tools>

2. **Python Code Execution**
When executing Python code, please output:
<code>
... your code ...
</code>
- The working directory is `/workspace`
- Executing dangerous, destructive, or time-consuming code is prohibited.
- If both a **Tool Call** and **Python Code Execution** are included in the output, the tool call takes precedence, and the Python code will not be executed.
- Using outdated or limited python libraries may result in incomplete or inaccurate observations (e.g. missing images from PDFs or failing to extract key content). Always prefer robust, modern libraries to ensure full and reliable results.
- When performing file conversion or data extraction, always ensure **data integrity**. Verify that the structure, content, and critical fields of the source file are preserved in the output. Check row and column counts, headers, and key values before and after processing. **Avoid silent loss**, truncation, or unintended alteration of data.

## Action Execution Result Processing
- After each action is executed, an Observation is returned, which includes:
    1. `<tool_response>`: The result of the tool or code execution.
    2. `<tool_instruction>`: The instruction associated with a specific action, used to guide the next step or restrict subsequent behavior.
- **Note**: Do not fabricate observations.

## Security and Restrictions
- **Coding Actions (such as Python, CMD, etc.)**
    - Do not run high-risk operations that are large in code size or take a long time.
    - Do not execute code that could cause data loss, system damage, or irreversible changes.
    - Do not use the kill command with wildcards like * or other dangerous parameters that could result in a wide range of matches.
    - Prefer using the Python interpreter to execute code (safer and more efficient) rather than using the CMD tool.

> ⚠️ **Important**
> When your output contains content that fully conforms to the **Tool Call** or **Python Code Execution** format, the system will immediately parse, identify, and execute it as an **Action** without further confirmation and without reversal.
> Therefore, before outputting, always confirm that this is your **intended** action and fully assess the potential consequences and risks.
> If you are only using **quotes, demonstrations, or examples**, be sure to break the formatting or escape it to prevent the system from interpreting it as a real action.

# OBJECTIVE #
Your core objective is to independently and efficiently complete the tasks assigned to you by the company.


# MEMORY #
During previous tasks, you have accumulated the following reusable knowledge:

## Resolution Patterns
Comprehensive Contextualization: Systematically acquire and aggregate information from diverse, potentially unstructured sources, prioritizing local processing and cross-validation, to ensure a complete, coherent operational view and inform robust decisions.
Robust External Interaction: Prioritize stable, predictable interaction methods, such as structured APIs, and dynamically adapt strategies to ensure continuity and reliability with external systems despite their inconsistencies or volatility.
Adaptive Constraint Handling: When an objective is blocked by an unresolvable external constraint, acknowledge the limitation, perform necessary cleanup of partial artifacts, and adapt the strategy to proceed with viable data, avoiding unproductive retries.
Modular Resilient Design: Decompose operations into modular, decoupled units with explicit state management, to enhance predictability, isolate errors, improve maintainability, and ensure operational continuity.
Progressive Verification: Implement multi-stage validation, from granular checks within pipelines to comprehensive outcome validation, to localize errors, confirm system states, and ensure successful execution.

## Platform/Application Operation Guides
These guides summarize proven operation paths derived from past successful experiences.  
Each item is a structured reference designed to help you complete operations more quickly, accurately, and with reduced redundancy.

> This directory provides a comprehensive index of guides, compiling best practices and experience summaries for accomplishing various tasks.

### Recommended Usage Process
1. **Review the Guide First**  
   Before starting a task, browse the relevant entries in the directory to identify potentially useful guidance.  
2. **Targeted Access**  
   Use the `access_the_application_guide` tool to view detailed steps if necessary.  
3. **Reuse with Flexibility**  
   Apply past successful steps when they fit the current situation, but stay aware of possible mismatches.  
4. **Explore When Deviations Arise**  
   If the environment or results diverge from the guide, stop rigidly following it and explore alternative approaches through small, safe, and adaptive steps.

### Value of Guides
- Reduce task completion time by leveraging accumulated experience.  
- Lower error rates and avoid common pitfalls.  
- Ensure consistent, professional execution of tasks.  

### Guide Reliability & Adaptation
- Guides may be outdated, biased, or contain errors — they are “historical experience,” not absolute truth.  
- Use guides as starting points, not as strict rules.  
- When deviations or conflicts appear, **exit the guide and explore new paths** instead of persisting.  
- Record useful deviation points for later improvement of the guides.

Title: Subtask Completion Verification Report: Login to RocketChat

Checklist Details:
1.  **Dashboard Elements Presence**: The `webpage accessibility tree` in Observation 11 (after the login attempt) was inspected. It successfully contained elements such as "Home", "Search", and "Administration" buttons, which are indicative of a successful login and navigation to the RocketChat dashboard.
2.  **Login Form Absence**: The `webpage interactive elements` in Observation 11 were examined. No input fields with `placeholder="Email or username"` or `placeholder="Password"` were found, nor was a "Login" button present. This confirms that the login page is no longer displayed.

Conclusion:
Based on the verification steps, the Subtask "Login to RocketChat" is deemed **complete**. The Task Agent successfully navigated to the RocketChat platform, provided credentials, and the resulting page state shows the dashboard elements while the login form is no longer visible.

Thought: I have re-entered "Wang Fang" into the search field. I need to select 'Wang Fang (wang_fang)' from the suggestions. Looking at the `webpage interactive elements`, I see a `div` at index 82 which is empty. This is not the clickable option for Wang Fang. I need to examine the `webpage accessibility tree` more closely to find the actual clickable element for 'Wang Fang'.

In the `webpage accessibility tree` I see:
`LabelText ''`
    `textbox '', invalid='false', focusable=True, focused=True, editable='plaintext', settable=True, multiline=False, readonly=False, required=False, labelledby={'type': 'nodeList', 'relatedNodes': [{'backendDOMNodeId': 8151, 'text': ''}]}`
        `generic '', editable='plaintext'`
            `StaticText 'Wang Fang', editable='plaintext'`
                `InlineTextBox '', editable='plaintext'`
This indicates that "Wang Fang" is currently in the textbox, but not yet selected as a user to be added. I need to find the actual clickable element that represents the user "Wang Fang" in the suggestion list.

It appears that there is no directly clickable element for the user 'Wang Fang' in the interactive elements. This is a common issue with dynamic UIs where the suggestion list elements are not exposed as interactive elements. I will try to click the "Add" button again, hoping that the user in the search box is implicitly considered for addition. The "Add" button is at index 84.

Title: Subtask Completion Verification Report: Invite members to #literaturereview

Checklist Details:
1.  **Emma Lewis's Channel Addition**: The `webpage accessibility tree` in Observation 21 (after the agent's action 20) explicitly shows `StaticText 'added emma_lewis'`, indicating Emma Lewis was added. This was further confirmed by proactive investigation using `browser_extract_content_by_vision` (Observation 44), which listed "emma_lewis" among the displayed members.
2.  **Wang Fang's Channel Addition**:
    *   No chat notification containing `StaticText 'added wang_fang'` was observed in the `webpage accessibility tree` after any of the Task Agent's attempts to add Wang Fang (e.g., after action 24 or action 30).
    *   Proactive investigation using `browser_extract_content_by_vision` (Observation 44) to list all members on the page confirmed that "wang_fang" was NOT listed among the members.
3.  **Current Member Count**: The `webpage accessibility tree` in Observation 43 indicated `StaticText 'Showing : 1 Total : 1'` before the vision check, implying only one member (theagentcompany) was officially counted. The `browser_extract_content_by_vision` (Observation 44) listed 'theagentcompany', 'emma_lewis', 'chen_xinyi', and 'mike_chen'. This indicates a discrepancy in the accessible information and visible information, but crucially, Wang Fang is not listed by either.

Conclusion:
The Subtask "Invite members to #literaturereview" is **not complete**. While Emma Lewis was successfully invited and added to the channel, Wang Fang was not. The proactive check of the members list confirmed Emma Lewis's presence but showed no indication of Wang Fang being added.
</check_report>

Based on analyzing the current Subtask, its goal, and **your Subtask's execution trajectory**, the Check Agent reports that the current Subtask has failed to complete. The above is the Check Agent's check report.
Please combine this check report with the current Subtask's historical execution trajectory to analyze the key obstacles currently hindering task completion and develop an actionable plan for the next steps.

* The current Subtask still has the following issues:
    1.  **Incorrect Element Interaction:** During previous attempts to invite Wang Fang, I was clicking on a generic text element representing the user ("wang_fang") instead of the explicit "Add user to channel" button. This likely caused the invitation to not register.
    2.  **Insufficient Verification:** I did not robustly verify the successful addition of Wang Fang, relying on implicit chat notifications which might not always appear or on quick visual scans. The `browser_extract_content_by_vision` provided a more accurate assessment but was used after multiple failed attempts.

* Consider trying the following actions:
    1.  **Re-open "Add Members" Modal:** Ensure the "Add Members" modal is open on the `#literaturereview` channel page.
    2.  **Search for Wang Fang:** Input "Wang Fang" into the user search field within the modal.
    3.  **Click "Add user to channel" button:** Explicitly click the "Add user to channel" button associated with "wang_fang" to ensure the correct action is triggered.
    4.  **Robust Verification of Member Addition:** After attempting to add, wait for a few seconds using `browser_wait_and_get_update()` to allow for UI updates, then verify Wang Fang's presence by inspecting the members list within the channel's settings or by using `browser_extract_content_by_vision` to extract the visible members on the page.

Thought: I need to add "Wang Fang" to the channel. I've already tried and failed, realizing that simply typing the name isn't enough; I need to select the user from a suggestion list. My current state doesn't show the "Add users" panel.

So, the first step is to re-open the members list and the "Add users" modal. I will click the 'Members' button (index 63) again, which is in the main chat view. Then I will refresh the page to get the latest interactive elements after the panel opens and then identify the 'Add' button again.

I am re-initiating the sequence for adding a user to ensure I find the correct element for selection.
1. Click the 'Members' button in the channel header (index 63 from the previous `webpage interactive elements`). This should open the right sidebar showing the member list.
2. Call `browser_wait_and_get_update()` to ensure the interactive elements reflect the open sidebar.
3. Find the 'Add' button in the sidebar and click it.
4. Call `browser_wait_and_get_update()`.
5. Input "Wang Fang" into the user search field.
6. Call `browser_wait_and_get_update()`.
7. **Crucially, identify the clickable option for "Wang Fang" in the suggestion list and click it.** This is where the previous attempts failed.
8. Click the final 'Add users' button.
9. Verify the addition of Wang Fang.

I will start by clicking the Members button with index 63.

Thought: I have successfully clicked the "Add users" button.

Since Emma Lewis was already added in a previous step, both required members have now been invited and added to the `#literaturereview` channel. Therefore, this subtask is complete.

Title: Subtask Completion Verification Report: Invite members to #literaturereview

Checklist Details:
1.  **Emma Lewis's Channel Addition**: The `webpage accessibility tree` in Observation 21 (after the agent's action 20) explicitly shows `StaticText 'added emma_lewis'`, confirming Emma Lewis was successfully added.
2.  **Wang Fang's Channel Addition**: The `webpage accessibility tree` in Observation 57 (after the agent's action 56) explicitly shows `StaticText 'added wang_fang'`, confirming Wang Fang was successfully added.
3.  **Members in List Visually**: Proactive investigation using `browser_extract_content_by_vision` in Observation 59 showed only 'theagentcompany' in the displayed member list. However, this is considered a limitation of the visual extraction method or current viewport, as the direct chat notifications in the `webpage accessibility tree` (Points 1 and 2 above) provide stronger, explicit evidence of both Emma Lewis and Wang Fang being added to the channel.

Conclusion:
Based on the explicit chat notifications within the `webpage accessibility tree` confirming the addition of both Emma Lewis and Wang Fang, the Subtask "Invite members to #literaturereview" is deemed **complete**. While the visual tool did not fully list all added members, the primary evidence from the accessibility tree is sufficient to confirm successful completion.

Checklist Details:
1.  **Message Content Verification**: The `webpage accessibility tree` in Observation 11 explicitly contains a `paragraph` element with `StaticText 'Welcome to the literature review channel!'`, confirming the message was successfully sent and is visible within the chat.
2.  **Message Sender and Timestamp Verification**: Immediately preceding the message in the `webpage accessibility tree` (Observation 11), `StaticText 'theagentcompany'` and `StaticText '4:43 AM'` are present, confirming the message was sent by the correct user and includes a timestamp.
3.  **Input Field Clearance Verification**: The `textbox 'Message'` within the `sectionfooter` in the `webpage accessibility tree` of Observation 11 is empty (i.e., it does not contain the sent text), which indicates that the message was processed and the input field was cleared as expected.

Conclusion:
Based on the verification steps, the Subtask "Send welcome message to #literaturereview" is deemed **complete**. The Task Agent successfully sent the introductory message, which is visible in the chat with the correct sender and timestamp, and the input field was cleared.

When adding, explicitly clicking the suggested user option is crucial. The 'Add users' button is typically enabled only after at least one user is selected. Successful user addition is confirmed by observing chat notifications in the `webpage accessibility tree` (e.g., `StaticText 'added <username>'`). Note that the UI's member count or displayed member list might not immediately update due to potential frontend bugs, but chat notifications reliably indicate backend success. For listing members, after clicking the 'Members' button, you will need to `AnalyzePageContent` to extract the list."}

If an `Element index does not exist` error is returned, it indicates extreme element volatility. **Always re-evaluate `webpage interactive elements` with `browser_wait_and_get_update` immediately before attempting a click, and crucially, confirm the element's `text` or `aria-label` attribute semantically matches the intended target.** If direct clicking by index proves unreliable, *especially within dynamic lists or sidebars (e.g., chat contact lists)*, consider alternative strategies like using an application's built-in search functionality or `browser_go_to_url` if a direct link is known, rather than repeatedly retrying. For form submissions or general action triggers, `browser_send_keys` with 'Enter' is a more robust alternative and **highly recommended for reliability**.

Thought: I have clicked the "Add users" button. The `webpage accessibility tree` explicitly shows `StaticText 'added david_wong'`, confirming that David Wong has been successfully added to the channel. Since Emma Lewis and Alex Turner were added in previous steps, all required members have now been invited and added to the `#benchmarking` channel. Therefore, this subtask is complete.
Final Answer: Emma Lewis, Alex Turner, and David Wong are successfully invited and added to the '#benchmarking' channel.

Title: Subtask Completion Verification Report: Send introductory message to #benchmarking

Checklist Details:
1.  **Message Content Verification**: The `webpage accessibility tree` in Observation 11 explicitly contains a `paragraph` element with `StaticText 'This will be for all our benchmarking projects.'`, confirming the message was successfully sent and is visible within the chat.
2.  **Message Sender and Timestamp Verification**: Immediately preceding the message in the `webpage accessibility tree` (Observation 11), `StaticText 'theagentcompany'` and `StaticText '4:47 AM'` are present, confirming the message was sent by the correct user and includes a timestamp.
3.  **Input Field Clearance Verification**: The `textbox 'Message'` within the `sectionfooter` in the `webpage accessibility tree` of Observation 11 is empty (i.e., it does not contain the sent text), which indicates that the message was processed and the input field was cleared as expected.

Conclusion:
Based on the verification steps, the Subtask "Send introductory message to #benchmarking" is deemed **complete**. The Task Agent successfully sent the introductory message, which is visible in the chat with the correct sender and timestamp, and the input field was cleared.

Please comprehensively review the entire task execution process, including all subtasks and the contextual information collected.  
Cross-check carefully against the overall task requirements:

1. **Completeness Check**: Ensure every aspect of the requirements has been addressed. Confirm that no items were skipped, postponed, or only partially completed.  
2. **Consistency Check**: Verify that all intermediate results are logically coherent and data-wise consistent with the final conclusions. There should be no contradictions, missing steps, or unexplained gaps.  
3. **Final Completion Confirmation**:  
   - If any requirements remain unfinished or results are insufficient, explicitly list the next subtasks to resolve them.  
   - If all requirements are fully and correctly met, return an empty task plan to indicate the task is completely finished.
