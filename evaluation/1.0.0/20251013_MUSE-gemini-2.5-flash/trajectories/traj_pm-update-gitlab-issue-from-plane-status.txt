# ACTION #
During task execution, you can perform **Actions**, including:
1. **Tool Call**
2. **Python Code Execution**

## Action Output Format
1. **Tool Call**
When calling a tool, please output:
<tool_call>
{"name": "<function-name>", "arguments": <args-json-object>}
</tool_call>
- `<function-name>`: Tool function name
- `<args-json-object>`: Call arguments (JSON format)

2. **Python Code Execution**
When executing Python code, please output:
<code>
... your code ...
</code>
- The working directory is `/workspace`
- Executing dangerous, destructive, or time-consuming code is prohibited.
- If both a **Tool Call** and **Python Code Execution** are included in the output, the tool call takes precedence, and the Python code will not be executed.
- Using outdated or limited python libraries may result in incomplete or inaccurate observations (e.g. missing images from PDFs or failing to extract key content). Always prefer robust, modern libraries to ensure full and reliable results.
- When performing file conversion or data extraction, always ensure **data integrity**. Verify that the structure, content, and critical fields of the source file are preserved in the output. Check row and column counts, headers, and key values before and after processing. **Avoid silent loss**, truncation, or unintended alteration of data.

## Action Execution Result Processing
- After each action is executed, an Observation is returned, which includes:
    1. `<tool_response>`: The result of the tool or code execution.
    2. `<tool_instruction>`: The instruction associated with a specific action, used to guide the next step or restrict subsequent behavior.
- **Note**: Do not fabricate observations.

## Security and Restrictions
- **Coding Actions (such as Python, CMD, etc.)**
    - Do not run high-risk operations that are large in code size or take a long time.
    - Do not execute code that could cause data loss, system damage, or irreversible changes.
    - Do not use the kill command with wildcards like * or other dangerous parameters that could result in a wide range of matches.
    - Prefer using the Python interpreter to execute code (safer and more efficient) rather than using the CMD tool.

> ⚠️ **Important**
> When your output contains content that fully conforms to the **Tool Call** or **Python Code Execution** format, the system will immediately parse, identify, and execute it as an **Action** without further confirmation and without reversal.
> Therefore, before outputting, always confirm that this is your **intended** action and fully assess the potential consequences and risks.
> If you are only using **quotes, demonstrations, or examples**, be sure to break the formatting or escape it to prevent the system from interpreting it as a real action.

# OBJECTIVE #
Your core objective is to independently and efficiently complete the tasks assigned to you by the company.


# MEMORY #
During previous tasks, you have accumulated the following reusable knowledge:

## Resolution Patterns
Comprehensive Contextualization: Systematically acquire and aggregate information from diverse, potentially unstructured sources, prioritizing local processing and cross-validation, to ensure a complete, coherent operational view and inform robust decisions.
Robust External Interaction: Prioritize stable, predictable interaction methods, such as structured APIs, and dynamically adapt strategies to ensure continuity and reliability with external systems despite their inconsistencies or volatility.
Adaptive Constraint Handling: When an objective is blocked by an unresolvable external constraint, acknowledge the limitation, perform necessary cleanup of partial artifacts, and adapt the strategy to proceed with viable data, avoiding unproductive retries.
Modular Resilient Design: Decompose operations into modular, decoupled units with explicit state management, to enhance predictability, isolate errors, improve maintainability, and ensure operational continuity.
Progressive Verification: Implement multi-stage validation, from granular checks within pipelines to comprehensive outcome validation, to localize errors, confirm system states, and ensure successful execution.

## Platform/Application Operation Guides
These guides summarize proven operation paths derived from past successful experiences.  
Each item is a structured reference designed to help you complete operations more quickly, accurately, and with reduced redundancy.

> This directory provides a comprehensive index of guides, compiling best practices and experience summaries for accomplishing various tasks.

### Recommended Usage Process
1. **Review the Guide First**  
   Before starting a task, browse the relevant entries in the directory to identify potentially useful guidance.  
2. **Targeted Access**  
   Use the `access_the_application_guide` tool to view detailed steps if necessary.  
3. **Reuse with Flexibility**  
   Apply past successful steps when they fit the current situation, but stay aware of possible mismatches.  
4. **Explore When Deviations Arise**  
   If the environment or results diverge from the guide, stop rigidly following it and explore alternative approaches through small, safe, and adaptive steps.

### Value of Guides
- Reduce task completion time by leveraging accumulated experience.  
- Lower error rates and avoid common pitfalls.  
- Ensure consistent, professional execution of tasks.  

### Guide Reliability & Adaptation
- Guides may be outdated, biased, or contain errors — they are “historical experience,” not absolute truth.  
- Use guides as starting points, not as strict rules.  
- When deviations or conflicts appear, **exit the guide and explore new paths** instead of persisting.  
- Record useful deviation points for later improvement of the guides.

Title: Subtask Completion Verification - Process Recall Rate Issue

Checklist Details:
-   **Verification of Plane Issue Status Extraction**: The Task Agent accurately extracted the status of 'Model: recall rate is 0' (OPENH-4) from the Plane issues page as 'To Do'. This is confirmed by the `browser_extract_content_by_vision` output in USER MESSAGE 05, which clearly shows `| OPENH-4 | Model: recall rate is O | To Do |`.
-   **Verification of Decision Logic for GitLab Action**: The Task Agent's decision to take no action on GitLab issue ID 4167 (Model: recall rate is 0) is consistent with the subtask's conditional logic. Since the Plane issue's status was 'To Do' (indicating an open state), the condition "If it is closed in Plane..." was not met, leading to the "Otherwise, ensure it remains open in GitLab" outcome as correctly stated by the Task Agent in ASSISTANT MESSAGE 06.
-   **Confirmation of GitLab Issue 4167 Status**: Proactive verification by navigating to the GitLab issues page (`http://the-agent-company.com:8929/root/openhands/-/issues/?state=all`) and inspecting the `webpage accessibility tree` in the latest observation confirms that issue #4167, "Model: recall rate is 0", is listed without any "Closed" indicator, thus remaining open. This aligns with the Task Agent's conclusion that no action was needed.

Conclusion:
The Subtask "Process Recall Rate Issue" is verified as complete. All checks confirm that the Task Agent correctly determined the status of the 'Model: recall rate is 0' issue in Plane and made the appropriate decision regarding the corresponding GitLab issue, which has been verified to remain open.

Title: Subtask Completion Verification - Process Security Problem Issue

Checklist Details:
-   **Verification of Plane Issue Status Extraction**: Re-extraction of the issue list from the Plane issues page (`http://the-agent-company.com:8091/tac/projects/73cb74f7-a7ac-4292-a915-e2f59a09a703/issues/`) using `browser_extract_content_by_vision` (Observation 05) confirms that 'Model: security problem' (OPENH-3) has a status of 'To Do'. This matches the Task Agent's stated status in ASSISTANT MESSAGE 04.
-   **Verification of Decision Logic for GitLab Action**: The Task Agent's decision to take no action on GitLab issue ID 4168 is logically sound. Since the Plane issue's status is 'To Do' (indicating an open state) and not 'Closed', the subtask's conditional requirement ("If it is closed in Plane... Otherwise, ensure it remains open in GitLab") correctly led to no action being taken in GitLab. The Task Agent's reasoning aligns with this logic (ASSISTANT MESSAGE 04).
-   **Confirmation of GitLab Issue 4168 Status**: Proactive navigation to the GitLab issues page (`http://the-agent-company.com:8929/root/openhands/-/issues/?state=all`) and inspection of the `webpage accessibility tree` (Observation 07) confirms that issue #4168, "Model: security problem", is listed without any "Closed" indicator, thus remaining open. This is consistent with the Task Agent's conclusion.

Conclusion:
The Subtask "Process Security Problem Issue" is verified as complete. All checks confirm that the Task Agent correctly determined the status of the 'Model: security problem' issue in Plane and made the appropriate decision regarding the corresponding GitLab issue, which has been verified to remain open.

Please comprehensively review the entire task execution process, including all subtasks and the contextual information collected.  
Cross-check carefully against the overall task requirements:

1. **Completeness Check**: Ensure every aspect of the requirements has been addressed. Confirm that no items were skipped, postponed, or only partially completed.  
2. **Consistency Check**: Verify that all intermediate results are logically coherent and data-wise consistent with the final conclusions. There should be no contradictions, missing steps, or unexplained gaps.  
3. **Final Completion Confirmation**:  
   - If any requirements remain unfinished or results are insufficient, explicitly list the next subtasks to resolve them.  
   - If all requirements are fully and correctly met, return an empty task plan to indicate the task is completely finished.  

Always remember that your ultimate goal is to complete task:
<task>
In Gitlab there are two issues for OpenHands, "Model: recall rate is 0" and "Model: security problem". For each of the issues, you need to check the status of the issue in Plane by going to the issue's page. If the issue is open in Plane, keep the issue open in Gitlab. If the issue is closed in Plane, close the issue in Gitlab.

The Plane issues page can be accessed at: http://the-agent-company.com:8091/tac/projects/73cb74f7-a7ac-4292-a915-e2f59a09a703/issues/

The GitLab issues page can be accessed at: http://the-agent-company.com:8929/root/openhands/-/issues/?state=all

75. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================
* The information you know and have obtained is:
    1. The task required synchronizing the status of two specific GitLab issues ("Model: recall rate is 0" and "Model: security problem") with their corresponding issues in Plane.
    2. The rule for synchronization was: If an issue is open in Plane, keep it open in GitLab. If an issue is closed in Plane, close it in GitLab.
    3. Successfully logged into GitLab using credentials: Email `root@local`, Password `theagentcompany`.
    4. Successfully logged into Plane using credentials: Email `agent@company.com`, Password `theagentcompany`.
    5. Navigated to the GitLab issues page: `http://the-agent-company.com:8929/root/openhands/-/issues/?state=all`.
    6. Identified the GitLab issue details:
        - "Model: security problem": Issue ID 4168, Status: Open.
        - "Model: recall rate is 0": Issue ID 4167, Status: Open.
    7. Navigated to the Plane project issues page: `http://the-agent-company.com:8091/tac/projects/73cb74f7-a7ac-4292-a915-e2f59a09a703/issues/`.
    8. Extracted the status of both issues from Plane using visual content extraction:
        - "Model: recall rate is 0" (Plane ID OPENH-4): Status is "To Do" (which corresponds to an open status).
        - "Model: security problem" (Plane ID OPENH-3): Status is "To Do" (which corresponds to an open status).
    9. Based on the Plane statuses, no action was required for either GitLab issue, as both were already open in GitLab and were found to be open ("To Do") in Plane.
