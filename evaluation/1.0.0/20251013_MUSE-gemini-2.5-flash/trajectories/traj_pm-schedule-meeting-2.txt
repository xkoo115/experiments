Returns a JSON object with `execution_status`, `returncode`, `stdout`, and `stderr`. **Important Precautions**: 1) `returncode=0` does not guarantee successful side effects (e.g., file creation); always verify with independent checks (`ls -l`, `file`). 2) **This tool executes commands in a *minimal* shell environment. Complex shell features like command chaining (`&&`, `||`), pipes (`|`), I/O redirection (`>`, `>>`), and backgrounding (`&`) are often *not reliably interpreted by `run_cmd` directly* and can lead to unexpected behavior or errors (e.g., `SyntaxError`, `command not found`). For any non-trivial shell interaction or complex logic, *always prefer consolidating operations into a single Python script that uses `subprocess` for explicit control and robustness* over multiple `run_cmd` calls or complex shell syntax.** 3) Quote arguments containing spaces (`\"path with spaces\"`). 4) State changes (`cd`) do not persist across calls.", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"command": {"type": "string", "description": "command暂时没有参数描述"}}, "required": ["command"]}}}
</tools>

2. **Python Code Execution**
When executing Python code, please output:
<code>
... your code ...
</code>
- The working directory is `/workspace`
- Executing dangerous, destructive, or time-consuming code is prohibited.
- If both a **Tool Call** and **Python Code Execution** are included in the output, the tool call takes precedence, and the Python code will not be executed.
- Using outdated or limited python libraries may result in incomplete or inaccurate observations (e.g. missing images from PDFs or failing to extract key content). Always prefer robust, modern libraries to ensure full and reliable results.
- When performing file conversion or data extraction, always ensure **data integrity**. Verify that the structure, content, and critical fields of the source file are preserved in the output. Check row and column counts, headers, and key values before and after processing. **Avoid silent loss**, truncation, or unintended alteration of data.

## Action Execution Result Processing
- After each action is executed, an Observation is returned, which includes:
    1. `<tool_response>`: The result of the tool or code execution.
    2. `<tool_instruction>`: The instruction associated with a specific action, used to guide the next step or restrict subsequent behavior.
- **Note**: Do not fabricate observations.

## Security and Restrictions
- **Coding Actions (such as Python, CMD, etc.)**
    - Do not run high-risk operations that are large in code size or take a long time.
    - Do not execute code that could cause data loss, system damage, or irreversible changes.
    - Do not use the kill command with wildcards like * or other dangerous parameters that could result in a wide range of matches.
    - Prefer using the Python interpreter to execute code (safer and more efficient) rather than using the CMD tool.

> ⚠️ **Important**
> When your output contains content that fully conforms to the **Tool Call** or **Python Code Execution** format, the system will immediately parse, identify, and execute it as an **Action** without further confirmation and without reversal.
> Therefore, before outputting, always confirm that this is your **intended** action and fully assess the potential consequences and risks.
> If you are only using **quotes, demonstrations, or examples**, be sure to break the formatting or escape it to prevent the system from interpreting it as a real action.

# OBJECTIVE #
Your core objective is to independently and efficiently complete the tasks assigned to you by the company.


# MEMORY #
During previous tasks, you have accumulated the following reusable knowledge:

## Resolution Patterns
Comprehensive Contextualization: Systematically acquire and aggregate information from diverse, potentially unstructured sources, prioritizing local processing and cross-validation, to ensure a complete, coherent operational view and inform robust decisions.
Robust External Interaction: Prioritize stable, predictable interaction methods, such as structured APIs, and dynamically adapt strategies to ensure continuity and reliability with external systems despite their inconsistencies or volatility.
Adaptive Constraint Handling: When an objective is blocked by an unresolvable external constraint, acknowledge the limitation, perform necessary cleanup of partial artifacts, and adapt the strategy to proceed with viable data, avoiding unproductive retries.
Modular Resilient Design: Decompose operations into modular, decoupled units with explicit state management, to enhance predictability, isolate errors, improve maintainability, and ensure operational continuity.
Progressive Verification: Implement multi-stage validation, from granular checks within pipelines to comprehensive outcome validation, to localize errors, confirm system states, and ensure successful execution.

## Platform/Application Operation Guides
These guides summarize proven operation paths derived from past successful experiences.  
Each item is a structured reference designed to help you complete operations more quickly, accurately, and with reduced redundancy.

> This directory provides a comprehensive index of guides, compiling best practices and experience summaries for accomplishing various tasks.

### Recommended Usage Process
1. **Review the Guide First**  
   Before starting a task, browse the relevant entries in the directory to identify potentially useful guidance.  
2. **Targeted Access**  
   Use the `access_the_application_guide` tool to view detailed steps if necessary.  
3. **Reuse with Flexibility**  
   Apply past successful steps when they fit the current situation, but stay aware of possible mismatches.  
4. **Explore When Deviations Arise**  
   If the environment or results diverge from the guide, stop rigidly following it and explore alternative approaches through small, safe, and adaptive steps.

### Value of Guides
- Reduce task completion time by leveraging accumulated experience.  
- Lower error rates and avoid common pitfalls.  
- Ensure consistent, professional execution of tasks.  

### Guide Reliability & Adaptation
- Guides may be outdated, biased, or contain errors — they are “historical experience,” not absolute truth.  
- Use guides as starting points, not as strict rules.  
- When deviations or conflicts appear, **exit the guide and explore new paths** instead of persisting.  
- Record useful deviation points for later improvement of the guides.

If an `Element index does not exist` error is returned, it indicates extreme element volatility. **Always re-evaluate `webpage interactive elements` with `browser_wait_and_get_update` immediately before attempting a click, and crucially, confirm the element's `text` or `aria-label` attribute semantically matches the intended target.** If direct clicking by index proves unreliable, *especially within dynamic lists or sidebars (e.g., chat contact lists)*, consider alternative strategies like using an application's built-in search functionality or `browser_go_to_url` if a direct link is known, rather than repeatedly retrying. For form submissions or general action triggers, `browser_send_keys` with 'Enter' is a more robust alternative and **highly recommended for reliability**.

Thought: I have successfully navigated to the RocketChat home page and logged in using the provided credentials. The presence of the RocketChat dashboard elements like "Home", "Search", "Directory", and direct message links for "liu_qiang" and "emily_zhou" in the `webpage accessibility tree` confirms that the login was successful.

Title: Subtask Completion Verification Report - Navigate to Rocketchat and Login

Checklist Details:
- **verify_current_url**: Checked whether the browser navigated to `http://the-agent-company.com:3000/home`.
    - **Finding**: Verified. The `webpage accessibility tree` in Observation 05 explicitly states `url='http://the-agent-company.com:3000/home'`.
- **verify_dashboard_elements_presence**: Checked for the presence of key RocketChat dashboard elements like 'Home', 'Search', 'Directory' buttons, and direct message links for 'liu_qiang' and 'emily_zhou'.
    - **Finding**: Verified. The `webpage accessibility tree` in Observation 11 clearly shows `button 'Home'`, `button 'Search'`, `button 'Directory'`, `link 'liu_qiang'`, and `link 'emily_zhou'`.
- **verify_login_form_absence**: Confirmed that login form elements (username input, password input, login button) are no longer present.
    - **Finding**: Verified. A comparison of `webpage interactive elements` between Observation 05 (login page) and Observation 11 (post-login) confirms the absence of the login input fields (e.g., `placeholder="Email or username"`, `placeholder="Password"`) and the "Login" button.

Conclusion:
The subtask "Navigate to Rocketchat and Login" is **complete**. The Task Agent successfully navigated to the RocketChat URL, provided credentials, and successfully logged in, as evidenced by the presence of dashboard elements and the absence of login form elements after the login attempt.

25. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================
Thought: The previous attempt to navigate to Emily Zhou's direct message conversation by clicking an element index was unsuccessful, as the browser remained in the 'general' channel. This confirms the volatility of element indices as highlighted in the `tool_instruction`. I will now use the `browser_go_to_url` tool with the direct message URL for Emily Zhou, which I can extract from the `href` attribute of the 'emily_zhou' link in the `webpage interactive elements`. The URL is `http://the-agent-company.com:3000/direct/CZYWHd5bCmhj5YcFeppuM42XhPD79wwxMv`. After navigating, I will use `browser_wait_and_get_update` to confirm the correct page has loaded.

Thought: I have successfully navigated to Liu Qiang's direct message conversation. The `webpage accessibility tree` confirms the heading is 'liu_qiang'. I can see a previous conversation where I asked Liu Qiang for his availability and he responded: "Hi! I'm available for meetings on Tuesday and Thursday during regular business hours this week. Let me know what works for you and Emily." This means I have already obtained his availability.

Therefore, this subtask is complete.
Final Answer: Liu Qiang's availability: Tuesday and Thursday during regular business hours.

Title: Subtask Completion Verification Report - Ask Liu Qiang for availability

Checklist Details:
- **verify_current_chat_with_liu_qiang**: Confirmed that the browser successfully navigated to the direct message chat with Liu Qiang and that the chat heading displayed 'liu_qiang'.
    - **Finding**: Verified. Observation 07 shows the URL as `http://the-agent-company.com:3000/direct/CZYWHd5bCmhj5YcFeGYMYHQKtWPAr47ZsE` and the `webpage accessibility tree` contains `heading 'liu_qiang', level=1`.
- **verify_message_sending_action**: Determined if the Task Agent performed explicit actions (e.g., using `browser_input_text` and `browser_send_keys`) within this subtask's execution to send a new message to Liu Qiang asking for availability.
    - **Finding**: Not Verified. The Task Agent did not perform actions to send a *new* message to Liu Qiang within this subtask's execution. Instead, as noted in Observation 08, the Task Agent found Liu Qiang's availability from a pre-existing conversation visible in the `webpage accessibility tree` in Observation 07. The explicit action of "sending a message" was thus bypassed.
- **verify_liu_qiang_response_received**: Confirmed that Liu Qiang's response message containing his availability is visible within the chat history on the current page.
    - **Finding**: Verified. Observation 07's `webpage accessibility tree` contains a `paragraph` element with Liu Qiang's response, attributed to `liu_qiang`.
- **verify_extracted_availability_accuracy**: Confirmed that the availability information stated in the Task Agent's 'Final Answer' accurately reflects Liu Qiang's response found in the chat history.
    - **Finding**: Verified. The Task Agent's 'Final Answer' in Observation 08 ("Tuesday and Thursday during regular business hours") directly matches the availability stated in Liu Qiang's message in Observation 07.

Conclusion:
The subtask "Ask Liu Qiang for availability" is **not complete**. While the Task Agent successfully navigated to Liu Qiang's chat, received his response (from a prior interaction), and accurately extracted his availability, it *failed to perform the explicit action of sending a message* within this subtask's execution, as specified by the subtask goal: "Successfully send a message to Liu Qiang asking for his free time, and receive and store his response." The availability was obtained from a pre-existing chat history, meaning the "send a message" part of the goal was not fulfilled.
</check_report>

Based on analyzing the current Subtask, its goal, and **your Subtask's execution trajectory**, the Check Agent reports that the current Subtask has failed to complete. The above is the Check Agent's check report.
Please combine this check report with the current Subtask's historical execution trajectory to analyze the key obstacles currently hindering task completion and develop an actionable plan for the next steps.

* The current Subtask still has the following issues:
    1. The subtask explicitly requires sending a message to Liu Qiang to ask for his free time, but I only extracted his availability from a pre-existing chat history without sending a new message.

* Consider trying the following actions:
    1. Navigate to Liu Qiang's direct message chat again.
    2. Construct and send a new message to Liu Qiang, explicitly asking for his free time on workdays during regular business hours for this week.
    3. Wait for Liu Qiang's response and extract his availability.

Replace `<target_name>` with the actual username or channel name. For channels, the search bar generally works with or without the '#' prefix. Successful navigation is verified by inspecting the `webpage accessibility tree` for the correct chat heading (e.g., `heading '<target_name>'`) and URL (e.g., `http://the-agent-company.com:3000/direct/<user_id>` or `http://the-agent-company.com:3000/channel/<channel_name>`).

If an obstructing sidebar (e.g., channel details) is open, it may need to be closed first (e.g., via `Browser: DismissOverlay`). Replace `<message_content>` with the actual message. Successful sending verified by observing `webpage accessibility tree` for the presence of a `paragraph` element containing the message content, typically preceded by `StaticText` for the sender username (e.g., `StaticText 'theagentcompany'`) and a timestamp (e.g., `StaticText '10:28 PM'`).
