# ACTION #
During task execution, you can perform **Actions**, including:
1. **Tool Call**
2. **Python Code Execution**

## Action Output Format
1. **Tool Call**
When calling a tool, please output:
<tool_call>
{"name": "<function-name>", "arguments": <args-json-object>}
</tool_call>
- `<function-name>`: Tool function name
- `<args-json-object>`: Call arguments (JSON format)

Complex shell features like command chaining (`&&`, `||`), pipes (`|`), I/O redirection (`>`, `>>`), and backgrounding (`&`) are often *not reliably interpreted by `run_cmd` directly* and can lead to unexpected behavior or errors (e.g., `SyntaxError`, `command not found`). For any non-trivial shell interaction or complex logic, *always prefer consolidating operations into a single Python script that uses `subprocess` for explicit control and robustness* over multiple `run_cmd` calls or complex shell syntax.** 3) Quote arguments containing spaces (`\"path with spaces\"`). 4) State changes (`cd`) do not persist across calls.", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"command": {"type": "string", "description": "command暂时没有参数描述"}}, "required": ["command"]}}}
</tools>

2. **Python Code Execution**
When executing Python code, please output:
<code>
... your code ...
</code>
- The working directory is `/workspace`
- Executing dangerous, destructive, or time-consuming code is prohibited.
- If both a **Tool Call** and **Python Code Execution** are included in the output, the tool call takes precedence, and the Python code will not be executed.
- Using outdated or limited python libraries may result in incomplete or inaccurate observations (e.g. missing images from PDFs or failing to extract key content). Always prefer robust, modern libraries to ensure full and reliable results.
- When performing file conversion or data extraction, always ensure **data integrity**. Verify that the structure, content, and critical fields of the source file are preserved in the output. Check row and column counts, headers, and key values before and after processing. **Avoid silent loss**, truncation, or unintended alteration of data.

## Action Execution Result Processing
- After each action is executed, an Observation is returned, which includes:
    1. `<tool_response>`: The result of the tool or code execution.
    2. `<tool_instruction>`: The instruction associated with a specific action, used to guide the next step or restrict subsequent behavior.
- **Note**: Do not fabricate observations.

## Security and Restrictions
- **Coding Actions (such as Python, CMD, etc.)**
    - Do not run high-risk operations that are large in code size or take a long time.
    - Do not execute code that could cause data loss, system damage, or irreversible changes.
    - Do not use the kill command with wildcards like * or other dangerous parameters that could result in a wide range of matches.
    - Prefer using the Python interpreter to execute code (safer and more efficient) rather than using the CMD tool.

> ⚠️ **Important**
> When your output contains content that fully conforms to the **Tool Call** or **Python Code Execution** format, the system will immediately parse, identify, and execute it as an **Action** without further confirmation and without reversal.
> Therefore, before outputting, always confirm that this is your **intended** action and fully assess the potential consequences and risks.
> If you are only using **quotes, demonstrations, or examples**, be sure to break the formatting or escape it to prevent the system from interpreting it as a real action.

# OBJECTIVE #
Your core objective is to independently and efficiently complete the tasks assigned to you by the company.


# MEMORY #
During previous tasks, you have accumulated the following reusable knowledge:

## Resolution Patterns
Comprehensive Contextualization: Systematically acquire and aggregate information from diverse, potentially unstructured sources, prioritizing local processing and cross-validation, to ensure a complete, coherent operational view and inform robust decisions.
Robust External Interaction: Prioritize stable, predictable interaction methods, such as structured APIs, and dynamically adapt strategies to ensure continuity and reliability with external systems despite their inconsistencies or volatility.
Adaptive Constraint Handling: When an objective is blocked by an unresolvable external constraint, acknowledge the limitation, perform necessary cleanup of partial artifacts, and adapt the strategy to proceed with viable data, avoiding unproductive retries.
Modular Resilient Design: Decompose operations into modular, decoupled units with explicit state management, to enhance predictability, isolate errors, improve maintainability, and ensure operational continuity.
Progressive Verification: Implement multi-stage validation, from granular checks within pipelines to comprehensive outcome validation, to localize errors, confirm system states, and ensure successful execution.

## Platform/Application Operation Guides
These guides summarize proven operation paths derived from past successful experiences.  
Each item is a structured reference designed to help you complete operations more quickly, accurately, and with reduced redundancy.

> This directory provides a comprehensive index of guides, compiling best practices and experience summaries for accomplishing various tasks.

### Recommended Usage Process
1. **Review the Guide First**  
   Before starting a task, browse the relevant entries in the directory to identify potentially useful guidance.  
2. **Targeted Access**  
   Use the `access_the_application_guide` tool to view detailed steps if necessary.  
3. **Reuse with Flexibility**  
   Apply past successful steps when they fit the current situation, but stay aware of possible mismatches.  
4. **Explore When Deviations Arise**  
   If the environment or results diverge from the guide, stop rigidly following it and explore alternative approaches through small, safe, and adaptive steps.

### Value of Guides
- Reduce task completion time by leveraging accumulated experience.  
- Lower error rates and avoid common pitfalls.  
- Ensure consistent, professional execution of tasks.  

### Guide Reliability & Adaptation
- Guides may be outdated, biased, or contain errors — they are “historical experience,” not absolute truth.  
- Use guides as starting points, not as strict rules.  
- When deviations or conflicts appear, **exit the guide and explore new paths** instead of persisting.  
- Record useful deviation points for later improvement of the guides.

<tool_instruction>
If an `Element index does not exist` error is returned, it indicates extreme element volatility. **Always re-evaluate `webpage interactive elements` with `browser_wait_and_get_update` immediately before attempting a click, and crucially, confirm the element's `text` or `aria-label` attribute semantically matches the intended target.** If direct clicking by index proves unreliable, *especially within dynamic lists or sidebars (e.g., chat contact lists)*, consider alternative strategies like using an application's built-in search functionality or `browser_go_to_url` if a direct link is known, rather than repeatedly retrying. For form submissions or general action triggers, `browser_send_keys` with 'Enter' is a more robust alternative and **highly recommended for reliability**.

This confirms 'copilot-arena-server' is the correct repository name.
2. **verify_identified_repository_url**:
    - **Outcome**: PASSED.
    - **Verification**: The `webpage interactive elements` in the Task Agent's observation (step 05) show `href="/root/copilot-arena-server"` for elements related to 'copilot-arena-server' (e.g., interactive elements at indices 81 and 82). The base URL is `http://the-agent-company.com:8929/` as indicated by the `RootWebArea` in the same observation. Combining these yields `http://the-agent-company.com:8929/root/copilot-arena-server`, matching the URL identified by the Task Agent.

Title: SubTask 3 Completion Verification Report: Clone the repository

Checklist Details:
1.  **verify_cloned_directory_existence**:
    *   **Outcome**: FAILED.
    *   **Verification**: The `run_cmd` output in the `verify_cloned_directory_existence` step yielded `stderr: "ls: cannot access '/workspace/copilot-arena-server/': No such file or directory"`. This confirms that the target directory for the cloned repository was not created.
2.  **verify_git_metadata_presence**:
    *   **Outcome**: FAILED.
    *   **Verification**: Since the `/workspace/copilot-arena-server` directory does not exist (as confirmed by the `ls -d` command output in the previous check), the `.git` metadata subdirectory cannot exist within it.
3.  **verify_remote_origin_correct**:
    *   **Outcome**: FAILED.
    *   **Verification**: As the repository was not successfully cloned and the target directory does not exist, there is no Git repository to inspect and thus, no remote origin URL to validate.

Conclusion: All checks have failed. The Subtask "Clone the repository" is considered incomplete. The core issue is the failure of the `git clone` operation itself, as indicated by the `returncode: 128` and the "fatal: could not read Username" error in the Task Agent's execution (step 09).
</check_report>

Based on analyzing the current Subtask, its goal, and **your Subtask's execution trajectory**, the Check Agent reports that the current Subtask has failed to complete. The above is the Check Agent's check report.
Please combine this check report with the current Subtask's historical execution trajectory to analyze the key obstacles currently hindering task completion and develop an actionable plan for the next steps.


73. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================
* The current Subtask still has the following issues:
    1. The `git clone` command failed due to a "fatal: could not read Username" error, indicating a lack of authentication.
    2. The repository was not cloned to the `/workspace` directory, resulting in the absence of the `copilot-arena-server` directory and its Git metadata.

* Consider trying the following actions:
    1. Attempt to clone the repository again, this time including the GitLab root username and password in the clone URL to authenticate the `git clone` operation. The format will be `git clone http://root@local:theagentcompany@the-agent-company.com:8929/root/copilot-arena-server.git /workspace/copilot-arena-server`.

When using `subprocess`, use `check=True` to raise `CalledProcessError` on non-zero exit codes for robust error handling. `capture_output=True` is essential for getting stdout/stderr."}

Thought: I have accessed the necessary guides. My next step is to locate the `requirements.txt` file within the cloned repository, which is located at `/workspace/copilot-arena-server`. I will use the `find` command as suggested by the `LocateFile` guide.

Always check `command_result.returncode`: `0` indicates success; non-zero suggests an error; analyze `command_result.stderr`. For successful commands, process `command_result.stdout`. *Note: `command_result.stderr` may contain non-error information; evaluate contextually.* **Crucially, for any sequence of shell commands or when integrating shell output with Python logic, *always encapsulate the entire interaction within a single Python script using `subprocess`* for maximum robustness and control, rather than relying on discrete `run_cmd` calls or shell features like redirection.**

Always check `command_result.returncode`: `0` indicates success; non-zero suggests an error; analyze `command_result.stderr`. For successful commands, process `command_result.stdout`. *Note: `command_result.stderr` may contain non-error information; evaluate contextually.* **Crucially, for any sequence of shell commands or when integrating shell output with Python logic, *always encapsulate the entire interaction within a single Python script using `subprocess`* for maximum robustness and control, rather than relying on discrete `run_cmd` calls or shell features like redirection.**
</tool_instruction>

93. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================
Thought: The `pip install -r` command successfully installed all the dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`. The `returncode` was 0, indicating success. Although there were warnings about running pip as root and an available pip update, these do not prevent the dependencies from being installed. Therefore, the goal of this subtask has been achieved.
Final Answer: All necessary Python dependencies for the API server have been installed within the cloned repository's environment.

Title: SubTask 4 Completion Verification Report: Install API server dependencies

Checklist Details:
1.  **verify_pip_command_success**:
    *   **Outcome**: PASSED.
    *   **Verification**: The Task Agent's observation in step 07 (`tool_response`) shows that the `pip install -r /workspace/copilot-arena-server/requirements.txt` command executed with a `returncode` of `0`. The `stdout` clearly indicates "Successfully installed" followed by a list of packages (e.g., "fastapi-0.116.1", "firebase-admin-7.1.0"), confirming the successful installation of dependencies.
2.  **verify_installed_package_availability**:
    *   **Outcome**: PASSED.
    *   **Verification**: A proactive check by the checking agent confirmed the availability of a key installed package. Executing a Python script to `import fastapi` resulted in `stdout: "Successfully imported 'fastapi'. Version: 0.116.1"` and a `returncode` of `0`, demonstrating that at least one of the installed dependencies is correctly set up and accessible in the Python environment.

Conclusion: All checks have passed. The Subtask "Install API server dependencies" is considered complete.
</check_report>

The Check Agent reports that the current Subtask has been completed. The above is the check report from the Check Agent.

95. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================
Got it! I'll continue with the task.
96. | ================================================== USER MESSAGE ==================================================
The current subtask has been successfully completed, and substantial new information has been obtained.  
Carefully review the updated context and determine how this new knowledge impacts the overall task progress.  
Design the next subtask to effectively leverage these insights and move closer to completing the full task.

Always remember that your ultimate goal is to complete task:
<task>
Find copilot arena's api server codebase in our gitlab (located at http://the-agent-company.com:8929/root/{CODEBASE_NAME}).
Clone the server repository to the /workspace folder and start up the API server locally.
Make sure to install the correct requirements.
Keep the API server running in background and is able to be called at http://localhost:5000
</task>
97. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================
* The information you know and have obtained is:
    1. The task requires finding and setting up the "copilot arena's api server codebase".
    2. The codebase is located on GitLab at `http://the-agent-company.com:8929/root/{CODEBASE_NAME}`.
    3. The GitLab login credentials are: Root Email: `root@local`, Root Password: `theagentcompany`.
    4. The repository needs to be cloned to the `/workspace` folder.
    5. Dependencies must be installed.
    6. The API server needs to be started and kept running in the background.
    7. The API server should be accessible at `http://localhost:5000`.
    8. Successfully logged into the GitLab instance.
    9. The 'copilot arena api server' codebase has been identified as the repository named `copilot-arena-server` at the URL `http://the-agent-company.com:8929/root/copilot-arena-server`.
    10. A Personal Access Token (PAT) `<security>-UwxWyqt7Y3174A2XfTsQ` was successfully generated on GitLab to authenticate cloning.
    11. The GitLab repository `copilot-arena-server` has been successfully cloned into the `/workspace/copilot-arena-server` directory using the PAT for authentication.
    12. All necessary Python dependencies for the API server have been installed from `/workspace/copilot-arena-server/requirements.txt`.

* The task can be divided into the following subtasks:
    1. Identify API server startup command: The correct command to start the `copilot-arena-server` API has been identified from the cloned repository's files.
    2. Start API server in background: The `copilot-arena-server` API has been successfully started in the background and is configured to listen on `http://localhost:5000`.
    3. Verify API server accessibility: A request to `http://localhost:5000` has successfully returned a response from the running API server, confirming its accessibility.
98. | ================================================== USER MESSAGE ==================================================
SubTask5: Identify API server startup command
Goal: The correct command to start the `copilot-arena-server` API has been identified from the cloned repository's files.
99. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================
Thought: The goal is to identify the API server startup command. This typically involves inspecting the cloned repository for common server startup scripts or configuration files. I will look for files like `app.py`, `main.py`, `run.py`, or a `Procfile` that might indicate how to start the server. I will use `ls -R` to list all files recursively within the cloned repository.

Analyze `stderr` for errors, `stdout` for output. `run_cmd` operates in isolated environments; `cd` does not persist across `run_cmd` calls.

For successful commands, process `command_result.stdout`. *Note: `command_result.stderr` may contain non-error information; evaluate contextually.* **Crucially, for any sequence of shell commands or when integrating shell output with Python logic, *always encapsulate the entire interaction within a single Python script using `subprocess`* for maximum robustness and control, rather than relying on discrete `run_cmd` calls or shell features like redirection.**

Thought: I have listed the contents of the `copilot-arena-server` directory and identified `app.py` as a likely entry point. Given that `fastapi` was installed as a dependency, it is common to start such applications using `uvicorn`. I will now read the content of `app.py` to confirm it's a FastAPI application and to identify the application instance name, which is typically `app`.

Always check `command_result.returncode`: `0` indicates success; non-zero suggests an error; analyze `command_result.stderr`. For successful commands, process `command_result.stdout`. *Note: `command_result.stderr` may contain non-error information; evaluate contextually.* **Crucially, for any sequence of shell commands or when integrating shell output with Python logic, *always encapsulate the entire interaction within a single Python script using `subprocess`* for maximum robustness and control, rather than relying on discrete `run_cmd` calls or shell features like redirection.**

Thought: I have successfully read the `app.py` file. The file clearly shows that it's a FastAPI application, and at the end, it defines `app = FastAPIApp().app`. This means the application object to be served by Uvicorn is `app` within the `app.py` module. The task specifies that the API server should be accessible at `http://localhost:5000`. Therefore, the correct command to start the API server is `uvicorn app:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 5000`. This command should be executed from within the `/workspace/copilot-arena-server` directory.

I have identified the correct command to start the `copilot-arena-server` API.
Final Answer: The correct command to start the `copilot-arena-server` API is `uvicorn app:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 5000`, to be executed from the `/workspace/copilot-arena-server` directory.

Title: SubTask 5 Completion Verification Report: Identify API server startup command

Checklist Details:
1.  **verify_app_object_in_app_py**:
    *   **Outcome**: PASSED.
    *   **Verification**: The `stdout` from the Task Agent's `cat /workspace/copilot-arena-server/app.py` command (step 07) clearly shows the line `app = FastAPIApp().app` at the end of the file. This confirms that a FastAPI application instance named `app` is defined and exposed within `app.py`.
2.  **verify_startup_command_correctness**:
    *   **Outcome**: PASSED.
    *   **Verification**: The identified startup command `uvicorn app:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 5000` is syntactically correct and aligns with common FastAPI deployment practices.
        *   `app:app`: The first `app` refers to the `app.py` module, and the second `app` refers to the `app` object defined within that module, which was confirmed in the previous check.
        *   `--host 0.0.0.0`: This is a standard argument to make the server accessible from outside the local machine, aligning with typical server deployments.
        *   `--port 5000`: This matches the task requirement that the API server should be accessible at `http://localhost:5000`.

Conclusion: All checks have passed. The Subtask "Identify API server startup command" is considered complete.

SubTask6: Start API server in background
Goal: The `copilot-arena-server` API has been successfully started in the background and is configured to listen on `http://localhost:5000`.
111. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================
Thought: The goal is to start the API server in the background, listening on `http://localhost:5000`. I have already identified the startup command: `uvicorn app:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 5000`. To run this in the background, I will need to use a shell command that allows background execution, such as `nohup` or by appending `&`. I will also need to `cd` into the repository directory first.

Thought: I have accessed the `ExecuteShellCommand` guide. It emphasizes using `subprocess` for complex shell interactions, which starting a background server certainly is. I will write a Python script to change the directory to `/workspace/copilot-arena-server` and then use `subprocess.Popen` to start the `uvicorn` server in the background. This will ensure the server runs independently and allows the current process to continue.

Thought: The Python script successfully started the API server in the background, as indicated by the `stdout` "API server started with PID: 319" and a `returncode` of 0. The use of `nohup` and `&` ensures that the server continues to run even after the current script finishes, and it is configured to listen on `http://localhost:5000`. Therefore, the goal of this subtask has been achieved.
Final Answer: The `copilot-arena-server` API has been successfully started in the background and is configured to listen on `http://localhost:5000`.

Title: SubTask 6 Completion Verification Report: Start API server in background

Checklist Details:
1.  **verify_uvicorn_process_running**:
    *   **Outcome**: PASSED.
    *   **Verification**: Executing a Python script with `subprocess.run("ps -ef | grep uvicorn", ...)` showed `stdout` containing the line `root 320 1 39 21:52 ? 00:00:07 /usr/local/bin/python3.12 /usr/local/bin/uvicorn app:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 5000`. This confirms that a uvicorn process is running in the background with the correct startup command and is not merely a `grep` process.
2.  **verify_port_5000_listening**:
    *   **Outcome**: PASSED.
    *   **Verification**: A `curl http://localhost:5000` command executed via `subprocess.run` returned `return code: 0` and `Stdout: {"detail":"Not Found"}`. This demonstrates that an HTTP server is actively listening on port 5000 and responding to requests, indicating the port is open and bound.
3.  **verify_api_server_responsiveness**:
    *   **Outcome**: PASSED.
    *   **Verification**: The `curl http://localhost:5000` command, as detailed in the previous check, successfully received an HTTP response (`{"detail":"Not Found"}`). This confirms the API server is functionally operating and responsive to HTTP requests, even if the specific endpoint requested (`/`) is not found.

Conclusion: All checks have passed. The Subtask "Start API server in background" is considered complete.
