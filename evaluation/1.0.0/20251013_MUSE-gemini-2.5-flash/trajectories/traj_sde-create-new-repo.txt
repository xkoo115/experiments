# ACTION #
During task execution, you can perform **Actions**, including:
1. **Tool Call**
2. **Python Code Execution**

## Action Output Format
1. **Tool Call**
When calling a tool, please output:
<tool_call>
{"name": "<function-name>", "arguments": <args-json-object>}
</tool_call>
- `<function-name>`: Tool function name
- `<args-json-object>`: Call arguments (JSON format)

The `webpage interactive elements` from its output are highly dynamic and should be used immediately. For verifying responses or dynamic updates, consider setting `seconds` to a value appropriate for expected latency (e.g., `seconds=1` for immediate state, longer for human-like response times). **This tool is a fundamental prerequisite for almost all subsequent browser interactions due to the highly dynamic nature of web UI element indices.**", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"seconds": {"type": "integer", "description": "The number of seconds to wait, the default is 3 seconds.", "default": 3}}, "required": []}}}

Returns a JSON object with `execution_status`, `returncode`, `stdout`, and `stderr`. **Important Precautions**: 1) `returncode=0` does not guarantee successful side effects (e.g., file creation); always verify with independent checks (`ls -l`, `file`). 2) **This tool executes commands in a *minimal* shell environment. Complex shell features like command chaining (`&&`, `||`), pipes (`|`), I/O redirection (`>`, `>>`), and backgrounding (`&`) are often *not reliably interpreted by `run_cmd` directly* and can lead to unexpected behavior or errors (e.g., `SyntaxError`, `command not found`). For any non-trivial shell interaction or complex logic, *always prefer consolidating operations into a single Python script that uses `subprocess` for explicit control and robustness* over multiple `run_cmd` calls or complex shell syntax.** 3) Quote arguments containing spaces (`\"path with spaces\"`). 4) State changes (`cd`) do not persist across calls.", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"command": {"type": "string", "description": "command暂时没有参数描述"}}, "required": ["command"]}}}
</tools>

2. **Python Code Execution**
When executing Python code, please output:
<code>
... your code ...
</code>
- The working directory is `/workspace`
- Executing dangerous, destructive, or time-consuming code is prohibited.
- If both a **Tool Call** and **Python Code Execution** are included in the output, the tool call takes precedence, and the Python code will not be executed.
- Using outdated or limited python libraries may result in incomplete or inaccurate observations (e.g. missing images from PDFs or failing to extract key content). Always prefer robust, modern libraries to ensure full and reliable results.
- When performing file conversion or data extraction, always ensure **data integrity**. Verify that the structure, content, and critical fields of the source file are preserved in the output. Check row and column counts, headers, and key values before and after processing. **Avoid silent loss**, truncation, or unintended alteration of data.

## Action Execution Result Processing
- After each action is executed, an Observation is returned, which includes:
    1. `<tool_response>`: The result of the tool or code execution.
    2. `<tool_instruction>`: The instruction associated with a specific action, used to guide the next step or restrict subsequent behavior.
- **Note**: Do not fabricate observations.

## Security and Restrictions
- **Coding Actions (such as Python, CMD, etc.)**
    - Do not run high-risk operations that are large in code size or take a long time.
    - Do not execute code that could cause data loss, system damage, or irreversible changes.
    - Do not use the kill command with wildcards like * or other dangerous parameters that could result in a wide range of matches.
    - Prefer using the Python interpreter to execute code (safer and more efficient) rather than using the CMD tool.

> ⚠️ **Important**
> When your output contains content that fully conforms to the **Tool Call** or **Python Code Execution** format, the system will immediately parse, identify, and execute it as an **Action** without further confirmation and without reversal.
> Therefore, before outputting, always confirm that this is your **intended** action and fully assess the potential consequences and risks.
> If you are only using **quotes, demonstrations, or examples**, be sure to break the formatting or escape it to prevent the system from interpreting it as a real action.

# OBJECTIVE #
Your core objective is to independently and efficiently complete the tasks assigned to you by the company.


# MEMORY #
During previous tasks, you have accumulated the following reusable knowledge:

## Resolution Patterns
Comprehensive Contextualization: Systematically acquire and aggregate information from diverse, potentially unstructured sources, prioritizing local processing and cross-validation, to ensure a complete, coherent operational view and inform robust decisions.
Robust External Interaction: Prioritize stable, predictable interaction methods, such as structured APIs, and dynamically adapt strategies to ensure continuity and reliability with external systems despite their inconsistencies or volatility.
Adaptive Constraint Handling: When an objective is blocked by an unresolvable external constraint, acknowledge the limitation, perform necessary cleanup of partial artifacts, and adapt the strategy to proceed with viable data, avoiding unproductive retries.
Modular Resilient Design: Decompose operations into modular, decoupled units with explicit state management, to enhance predictability, isolate errors, improve maintainability, and ensure operational continuity.
Progressive Verification: Implement multi-stage validation, from granular checks within pipelines to comprehensive outcome validation, to localize errors, confirm system states, and ensure successful execution.

## Platform/Application Operation Guides
These guides summarize proven operation paths derived from past successful experiences.  
Each item is a structured reference designed to help you complete operations more quickly, accurately, and with reduced redundancy.

> This directory provides a comprehensive index of guides, compiling best practices and experience summaries for accomplishing various tasks.

### Recommended Usage Process
1. **Review the Guide First**  
   Before starting a task, browse the relevant entries in the directory to identify potentially useful guidance.  
2. **Targeted Access**  
   Use the `access_the_application_guide` tool to view detailed steps if necessary.  
3. **Reuse with Flexibility**  
   Apply past successful steps when they fit the current situation, but stay aware of possible mismatches.  
4. **Explore When Deviations Arise**  
   If the environment or results diverge from the guide, stop rigidly following it and explore alternative approaches through small, safe, and adaptive steps.

### Value of Guides
- Reduce task completion time by leveraging accumulated experience.  
- Lower error rates and avoid common pitfalls.  
- Ensure consistent, professional execution of tasks.  

### Guide Reliability & Adaptation
- Guides may be outdated, biased, or contain errors — they are “historical experience,” not absolute truth.  
- Use guides as starting points, not as strict rules.  
- When deviations or conflicts appear, **exit the guide and explore new paths** instead of persisting.  
- Record useful deviation points for later improvement of the guides.

Thought: I have successfully logged into RocketChat. The page now shows the RocketChat dashboard with various channels and direct messages. The next step is to find Zhang Wei and send him a message. I need to identify Zhang Wei in the direct messages or search for him. Looking at the `webpage accessibility tree`, I see "mike_chen" and "chen_xinyi" but not Zhang Wei. I will use the search functionality to find Zhang Wei. I see a search button at index 5. I will click on it to open the search bar.

If an `Element index does not exist` error is returned, it indicates extreme element volatility. **Always re-evaluate `webpage interactive elements` with `browser_wait_and_get_update` immediately before attempting a click, and crucially, confirm the element's `text` or `aria-label` attribute semantically matches the intended target.** If direct clicking by index proves unreliable, *especially within dynamic lists or sidebars (e.g., chat contact lists)*, consider alternative strategies like using an application's built-in search functionality or `browser_go_to_url` if a direct link is known, rather than repeatedly retrying. For form submissions or general action triggers, `browser_send_keys` with 'Enter' is a more robust alternative and **highly recommended for reliability**.

## Subtask Completion Report: Create New GitLab Repository

### Checklist Details

1.  **Project URL Accessibility**:
    *   **Verification**: Attempted to access the target URL `http://the-agent-company.com:8929/root/new-storage-project` directly (Observation 41).
    *   **Finding**: The browser returned a "404: Page not found" error, as seen in the `<webpage accessibility tree>` of Observation 41. This indicates the project is not accessible at the specified URL.
    *   **Status**: **FAIL**

2.  **Project Listing in GitLab**:
    *   **Verification**: Navigated to the GitLab projects page (`http://the-agent-company.com:8929/`) and executed Python code to search for a project named 'New Storage Project' within the `webpage interactive elements` (Observation 42).
    *   **Finding**: The Python code returned the result `Project 'New Storage Project' found: False`, as shown in `stdout` of Observation 42. This confirms the project does not exist in the list of projects for the logged-in user.
    *   **Status**: **FAIL**

### Conclusion

The Subtask "Create New GitLab Repository" is **not complete**. Both verification steps indicate that the GitLab repository 'New Storage Project' was not successfully created at the specified URL or is not visible in the project listing.
</check_report>

Based on analyzing the current Subtask, its goal, and **your Subtask's execution trajectory**, the Check Agent reports that the current Subtask has failed to complete. The above is the Check Agent's check report.
Please combine this check report with the current Subtask's historical execution trajectory to analyze the key obstacles currently hindering task completion and develop an actionable plan for the next steps.


75. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================
* The current Subtask still has the following issues:
    1. The GitLab repository "New Storage Project" was not successfully created as confirmed by both the 404 error on direct URL access and the absence of the project in the listed projects.
    2. The previous attempt to create the project through UI interaction (clicks on "New project", "Create blank project", setting name and visibility, and clicking "Create project") did not result in a successful project creation, possibly due to volatile element indices or an incomplete form submission.

* Consider trying the following actions:
    1. Re-attempt the GitLab project creation process, but this time, after filling in the project name and setting visibility, use `browser_send_keys("Enter")` instead of `browser_click` for the "Create project" action to ensure a more robust form submission.
    2. After attempting project creation, navigate to the "Projects" page (`http://the-agent-company.com:8929/dashboard/projects`) and explicitly search for "New Storage Project" to verify its creation and extract its actual URL.
    3. If the project creation still fails after using `browser_send_keys`, carefully review the `webpage accessibility tree` and `webpage interactive elements` for any error messages or unexpected UI states that might indicate why the project creation is not succeeding.

Thought: The GitLab repository "New Storage Project" was still not created despite multiple attempts, including using `browser_send_keys("Enter")`. This suggests a potential issue with the UI interaction or a background process not completing in time.

I will attempt to create the project one more time with a slightly refined approach:
1. Navigate back to the "Create blank project" page.
2. Input the project name.
3. Select "Public" visibility.
4. **Explicitly click the "Create project" button (index 69)**, instead of relying on "Enter" key, in case GitLab expects a direct click.
5. After clicking, I will include a longer wait time (`seconds=10`) to allow GitLab to fully process the creation and redirect.
6. Finally, I will attempt to navigate directly to the expected repository URL to verify creation. If it is still not there, I will try to find a list of all projects and check the presence of "New Storage Project" there.

Let's navigate back to the project creation page first.

## Subtask Completion Report: Create New GitLab Repository

### Checklist Details

1.  **Verify Direct URL Accessibility**:
    *   **Verification**: Attempted to navigate directly to the specified repository URL: `http://the-agent-company.com:8929/root/new-storage-project`.
    *   **Finding**: The browser returned a "404: Page not found" error (Observations 29, 41, 57, 69). This indicates that the repository does not exist or is not accessible at the given URL.
    *   **Status**: **FAIL**

2.  **Verify Project Listing on Projects Dashboard**:
    *   **Verification**: Navigated to the GitLab projects dashboard (`http://the-agent-company.com:8929/dashboard/projects`) and used a Python script to search for "New Storage Project" within the `webpage interactive elements`.
    *   **Finding**: The script reported "Project 'New Storage Project' not found on this page" (Observations 73, 79, 83). This confirms the project is not listed among the user's current repositories.
    *   **Status**: **FAIL**

3.  **Verify Public Visibility Setting**:
    *   **Verification**: This check was dependent on the successful creation and existence of the "New Storage Project" repository.
    *   **Finding**: Since the repository was not found in the previous two checks, its visibility setting cannot be verified.
    *   **Status**: **N/A (Prerequisite Not Met)**

### Conclusion

The Subtask "Create New GitLab Repository" is **not complete**. The project "New Storage Project" was not successfully created or is not accessible at the specified URL, nor does it appear in the user's project list on the GitLab dashboard. The task agent's attempts to create the repository via UI interactions (clicking and `send_keys`) have not yielded the desired result.
</check_report>

Based on analyzing the current Subtask, its goal, and **your Subtask's execution trajectory**, the Check Agent reports that the current Subtask has failed to complete. The above is the Check Agent's check report.
Please combine this check report with the current Subtask's historical execution trajectory to analyze the key obstacles currently hindering task completion and develop an actionable plan for the next steps.


119. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================
* The current Subtask still has the following issues:
    1. The GitLab repository "New Storage Project" was not successfully created or is not accessible, as indicated by the "404: Page not found" error when accessing the direct URL and its absence from the projects dashboard.
    2. My previous attempts to create the repository relied solely on UI interactions (clicks and text inputs), which proved unreliable due to dynamic element indices and potential unhandled UI states (e.g., missed submission confirmation).
    3. I lacked a robust, programmatic method to confirm the successful creation of the repository, leading to a failure in detecting the initial problem.

* Consider trying the following actions:
    1. Generate a GitLab Personal Access Token (PAT) using the `AccessPersonalAccessTokensPage` and `GeneratePersonalAccessToken` guides. This token will be necessary for API-based interactions with GitLab.
    2. Utilize the GitLab API to create the "New Storage Project" repository. This will involve using `run_cmd` with `curl` commands or a Python script to interact directly with the GitLab API endpoint for project creation, providing a more robust and verifiable approach than UI interactions.
    3. After attempting project creation, use the `ListProjectsViaAPI` tool to programmatically verify that the "New Storage Project" has been successfully created and is listed under the 'root' user's projects.
120. | ================================================== USER MESSAGE ==================================================
The current subtask has already been attempted 2 times but remains unresolved.  
Do not simply retry the same approach. Carefully review all available task information and execution history, identify why previous attempts failed, and propose a new angle or breakthrough strategy.  
Update the next subtask with a clear, revised plan that has a higher chance of success.  

Always remember that your ultimate goal is to complete task:
<task>
Your leader Zhang Wei proposed a new project in storage system. You need to ask him about the project and receive
some specific tasks for this project. 

* Ask Zhang Wei about the project and some concrete tasks. You can find them on http://the-agent-company.com:3000/.
* Create a new gitlab repo called New Storage Project. Set the permission to public. The final repo URL should be 
http://the-agent-company.com:8929/root/new-storage-project. 
* Update the README.md file in the repo and add some description about the new storage project.
</task>
121. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================
* The information you know and have obtained is:
    1. My leader Zhang Wei proposed a new project in storage system, and I have successfully communicated with him on Rocket.Chat.
    2. The new storage project is focused on enhancing the data retrieval speed and optimizing storage efficiency for our streaming database.
    3. Specific tasks for the project include: Performance Benchmarking, Data Compression Algorithms, Fault Tolerance Mechanisms, and Scalability Testing.
    4. I need to create a new public GitLab repository named "New Storage Project".
    5. The final repository URL should be `http://the-agent-company.com:8929/root/new-storage-project`.
    6. I need to update the `README.md` file in the repository with a description of the new storage project.
    7. Attempts to create the GitLab repository through UI interactions (clicking buttons and sending keys) have repeatedly failed, resulting in the project not being created or listed.
    8. I am successfully logged into GitLab with root credentials (`root`/`theagentcompany`).
    9. I have identified that using the GitLab API for repository creation is a more reliable approach.
    10. I have accessed the `AccessPersonalAccessTokensPage` and `GeneratePersonalAccessToken` guides for GitLab, which are necessary steps to interact with the GitLab API.

* The task can be divided into the following subtasks:
    1. Generate GitLab Personal Access Token: A Personal Access Token (PAT) with necessary scopes (e.g., 'api' or 'write_repository') is successfully generated and extracted from GitLab.
    2. Create New GitLab Repository via API: A new public GitLab repository named 'New Storage Project' is successfully created using the GitLab API.
    3. Verify GitLab Repository Creation via API: The newly created 'New Storage Project' repository is confirmed to exist and be accessible (public) via the GitLab API.

Thought: I have successfully navigated to the "Personal Access Tokens" page and clicked the "Add new token" button. Now I need to fill in the token details.

According to the `GeneratePersonalAccessToken` guide, the next steps are:
1. Identify the input field for 'Token name' (e.g., `textbox 'Token name'`)
2. `browser_input_text(index=<token_name_input_index>, text="<token_name>")`
3. Identify the checkbox for the desired scope (e.g., `checkbox 'read_api'`)
4. `browser_click(index=<scope_checkbox_index>)`
5. `browser_send_keys(keys="Enter")`
6. Identify the 'Click to reveal' button
7. `browser_click(index=<click_to_reveal_button_index>)`
8. Analyze `webpage accessibility tree` to extract the token value.

Looking at the `webpage interactive elements`:
- Token name input field: index 57, `input type=text name=personal_access...`
- I will name the token "NewStorageProject_API_Token".
- For scopes, I need `api` or `write_repository`. The `api` scope (index 62) grants complete read/write access to the API, which is sufficient for creating a project. I will select this.
- The "Create personal access token" button is not listed in the interactive elements, but I will use `browser_send_keys("Enter")` after selecting the scope.

First, input the token name.

## Subtask Completion Report: Generate GitLab Personal Access Token

### Checklist Details

1.  **Verify Generated Token Details**:
    *   **Verification**: Inspected the `webpage accessibility tree` in Observation 19 to confirm the presence of a token named 'NewStorageProject_API_Token' in the GitLab Personal Access Token list.
    *   **Finding**: A table cell containing the text 'NewStorageProject_API_Token' was found at line 315 in the `webpage accessibility tree` of Observation 19, confirming the token's presence.
    *   **Status**: **PASS**

2.  **Verify Token Scopes**:
    *   **Verification**: Examined the `webpage accessibility tree` in Observation 19 for the scopes associated with 'NewStorageProject_API_Token' to ensure either 'api' or 'write_repository' scope was enabled.
    *   **Finding**: The `webpage accessibility tree` (Observation 19, line 317) explicitly shows that the 'NewStorageProject_API_Token' has the `k8s_proxy` scope. This does not match the required 'api' or 'write_repository' scopes. The Task Agent's intention in Observation 14 was to select the 'api' scope, but this was not reflected in the outcome.
    *   **Status**: **FAIL**

3.  **Verify Extracted Token Value**:
    *   **Verification**: Compared the token value extracted by the Task Agent (`glpat-Mtq9qeWDh4JvWoc2sxM4`) with the revealed token in the `webpage accessibility tree` of Observation 21.
    *   **Finding**: The value `glpat-Mtq9qeWDh4JvWoc2sxM4` found in the `webpage accessibility tree` (Observation 21) precisely matches the token value extracted by the Task Agent.
    *   **Status**: **PASS**

### Conclusion

The Subtask "Generate GitLab Personal Access Token" is **not complete**. Although the token was generated and its value correctly extracted, the crucial requirement of enabling the appropriate scopes ('api' or 'write_repository') was not met. The generated token was incorrectly assigned the 'k8s_proxy' scope, which is insufficient for the intended purpose.
</check_report>

Based on analyzing the current Subtask, its goal, and **your Subtask's execution trajectory**, the Check Agent reports that the current Subtask has failed to complete. The above is the Check Agent's check report.
Please combine this check report with the current Subtask's historical execution trajectory to analyze the key obstacles currently hindering task completion and develop an actionable plan for the next steps.


145. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================
* The current Subtask still has the following issues:
    1. The Personal Access Token (PAT) was generated with the incorrect scope (`k8s_proxy`) instead of the required `api` or `write_repository`, rendering it unusable for creating GitLab repositories via the API.
    2. My previous attempt to select the scope involved clicking an element at an index (index 14) that corresponded to an incorrect scope, indicating a misidentification of the correct scope checkbox during the UI interaction.

* Consider trying the following actions:
    1. Navigate back to the GitLab Personal Access Tokens page (`http://the-agent-company.com:8929/-/user_settings/personal_access_tokens`).
    2. If a delete option is available for the "NewStorageProject_API_Token", delete the incorrectly scoped token to avoid confusion.
    3. Carefully re-identify the interactive element index for the "api" scope checkbox on the PAT creation form.
    4. Generate a new Personal Access Token, ensuring the correct "api" scope checkbox is selected.
    5. Extract and securely store the newly generated PAT value.

## Subtask Completion Report: Create New GitLab Repository via API

### Checklist Details

1.  **Verify Direct Repository Access**:
    *   **Verification**: Navigated directly to `http://the-agent-company.com:8929/root/new-storage-project`.
    *   **Finding**: The browser successfully loaded the project page, displaying "Administrator / New Storage Project · GitLab" as the title and "New Storage Project" within the main content (Observation 07).
    *   **Status**: **PASS**

2.  **Verify Project Listing in GitLab UI**:
    *   **Verification**: Navigated to the GitLab projects dashboard (`http://the-agent-company.com:8929/dashboard/projects`) and inspected the `webpage interactive elements`.
    *   **Finding**: The "New Storage Project" was clearly listed as an interactive element (`index: 107`, `text: <a >New Storage Project/>`) on the projects dashboard (Observation 08).
    *   **Status**: **PASS**

3.  **Confirm Public Visibility of the Repository**:
    *   **Verification**: After navigating back to the 'New Storage Project' page, `browser_extract_content_by_vision` was used to query for explicit visibility information.
    *   **Finding**: The visual model confirmed the presence of a "globe icon" next to the project title, which is the standard GitLab indicator for a public repository (Observation 10). This visually corroborates the `public` setting used during API creation in Observation 05.
    *   **Status**: **PASS**

### Conclusion

The Subtask "Create New GitLab Repository via API" is **complete**. The new public GitLab repository named 'New Storage Project' was successfully created, is directly accessible via its URL, is listed on the GitLab projects dashboard, and its public visibility is confirmed on the repository page.

Thought: I have accessed the guides for `ReadFile`, `WriteFile`, and `ProcessAndFormatStringData`.

The plan to update the `README.md` is as follows:
1. **Read the existing `README.md`**: Use `ReadFile` to get the current content of `/workspace/new-storage-project/README.md`. Since I created the project with a `README.md`, it should exist, even if it's minimal.
2. **Format the new content**: I have the project description and tasks from Zhang Wei. I will format this information into a markdown-friendly string.
    - Project Description: "The new storage project is focused on enhancing the data retrieval speed and optimizing storage efficiency for our streaming database."
    - Tasks:
        - Performance Benchmarking: Set up a framework to benchmark the current storage performance.
        - Data Compression Algorithms: Explore and implement efficient data compression techniques.
        - Fault Tolerance Mechanisms: Design and integrate robust fault tolerance mechanisms.
        - Scalability Testing: Conduct tests to ensure that our storage solutions can scale efficiently as data volumes grow.
3. **Write the new content to `README.md`**: Use `WriteFile` to overwrite the existing `README.md` with the newly formatted content.

First, I will read the existing `README.md` file to see its current content.

Thought: The `cat` command failed because `README.md` does not exist in `/workspace/new-storage-project`. This indicates that creating the project via API did not automatically initialize it with a `README.md` file, contrary to what might be expected from UI creation.

Therefore, I need to create the `README.md` file and populate it with the project description and tasks. I will construct the content as a markdown string and then use the `WriteFile` guide to create the file.

The content for the `README.md` will be:

```markdown
# New Storage Project

## Project Description
The new storage project is focused on enhancing the data retrieval speed and optimizing storage efficiency for our streaming database.

## Tasks
- **Performance Benchmarking**: Set up a framework to benchmark the current storage performance.
- **Data Compression Algorithms**: Explore and implement efficient data compression techniques.
- **Fault Tolerance Mechanisms**: Design and integrate robust fault tolerance mechanisms.
- **Scalability Testing**: Conduct tests to ensure that our storage solutions can scale efficiently as data volumes grow.
```
