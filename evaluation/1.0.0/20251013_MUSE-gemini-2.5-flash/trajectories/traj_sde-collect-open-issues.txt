# ACTION #
During task execution, you can perform **Actions**, including:
1. **Tool Call**
2. **Python Code Execution**

## Action Output Format
1. **Tool Call**
When calling a tool, please output:
<tool_call>
{"name": "<function-name>", "arguments": <args-json-object>}
</tool_call>
- `<function-name>`: Tool function name
- `<args-json-object>`: Call arguments (JSON format)
- If multiple `<tool_call>` are output at once, only the first one will be executed; the rest will be ignored.

Available tool signatures are provided within the `<tools>` tag:

Complex shell features like command chaining (`&&`, `||`), pipes (`|`), I/O redirection (`>`, `>>`), and backgrounding (`&`) are often *not reliably interpreted by `run_cmd` directly* and can lead to unexpected behavior or errors (e.g., `SyntaxError`, `command not found`). For any non-trivial shell interaction or complex logic, *always prefer consolidating operations into a single Python script that uses `subprocess` for explicit control and robustness* over multiple `run_cmd` calls or complex shell syntax.** 3) Quote arguments containing spaces (`\"path with spaces\"`). 4) State changes (`cd`) do not persist across calls.", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"command": {"type": "string", "description": "command暂时没有参数描述"}}, "required": ["command"]}}}

2. **Python Code Execution**
When executing Python code, please output:
<code>
... your code ...
</code>
- The working directory is `/workspace`
- Executing dangerous, destructive, or time-consuming code is prohibited.
- If both a **Tool Call** and **Python Code Execution** are included in the output, the tool call takes precedence, and the Python code will not be executed.
- Using outdated or limited python libraries may result in incomplete or inaccurate observations (e.g. missing images from PDFs or failing to extract key content). Always prefer robust, modern libraries to ensure full and reliable results.
- When performing file conversion or data extraction, always ensure **data integrity**. Verify that the structure, content, and critical fields of the source file are preserved in the output. Check row and column counts, headers, and key values before and after processing. **Avoid silent loss**, truncation, or unintended alteration of data.

## Action Execution Result Processing
- After each action is executed, an Observation is returned, which includes:
    1. `<tool_response>`: The result of the tool or code execution.
    2. `<tool_instruction>`: The instruction associated with a specific action, used to guide the next step or restrict subsequent behavior.
- **Note**: Do not fabricate observations.

## Security and Restrictions
- **Coding Actions (such as Python, CMD, etc.)**
    - Do not run high-risk operations that are large in code size or take a long time.
    - Do not execute code that could cause data loss, system damage, or irreversible changes.
    - Do not use the kill command with wildcards like * or other dangerous parameters that could result in a wide range of matches.
    - Prefer using the Python interpreter to execute code (safer and more efficient) rather than using the CMD tool.

> ⚠️ **Important**
> When your output contains content that fully conforms to the **Tool Call** or **Python Code Execution** format, the system will immediately parse, identify, and execute it as an **Action** without further confirmation and without reversal.
> Therefore, before outputting, always confirm that this is your **intended** action and fully assess the potential consequences and risks.
> If you are only using **quotes, demonstrations, or examples**, be sure to break the formatting or escape it to prevent the system from interpreting it as a real action.

# OBJECTIVE #
Your core objective is to independently and efficiently complete the tasks assigned to you by the company.


# MEMORY #
During previous tasks, you have accumulated the following reusable knowledge:

## Resolution Patterns
Comprehensive Contextualization: Systematically acquire and aggregate information from diverse, potentially unstructured sources, prioritizing local processing and cross-validation, to ensure a complete, coherent operational view and inform robust decisions.
Robust External Interaction: Prioritize stable, predictable interaction methods, such as structured APIs, and dynamically adapt strategies to ensure continuity and reliability with external systems despite their inconsistencies or volatility.
Adaptive Constraint Handling: When an objective is blocked by an unresolvable external constraint, acknowledge the limitation, perform necessary cleanup of partial artifacts, and adapt the strategy to proceed with viable data, avoiding unproductive retries.
Modular Resilient Design: Decompose operations into modular, decoupled units with explicit state management, to enhance predictability, isolate errors, improve maintainability, and ensure operational continuity.
Progressive Verification: Implement multi-stage validation, from granular checks within pipelines to comprehensive outcome validation, to localize errors, confirm system states, and ensure successful execution.

## Platform/Application Operation Guides
These guides summarize proven operation paths derived from past successful experiences.  
Each item is a structured reference designed to help you complete operations more quickly, accurately, and with reduced redundancy.

> This directory provides a comprehensive index of guides, compiling best practices and experience summaries for accomplishing various tasks.

### Recommended Usage Process
1. **Review the Guide First**  
   Before starting a task, browse the relevant entries in the directory to identify potentially useful guidance.  
2. **Targeted Access**  
   Use the `access_the_application_guide` tool to view detailed steps if necessary.  
3. **Reuse with Flexibility**  
   Apply past successful steps when they fit the current situation, but stay aware of possible mismatches.  
4. **Explore When Deviations Arise**  
   If the environment or results diverge from the guide, stop rigidly following it and explore alternative approaches through small, safe, and adaptive steps.

### Value of Guides
- Reduce task completion time by leveraging accumulated experience.  
- Lower error rates and avoid common pitfalls.  
- Ensure consistent, professional execution of tasks.  

### Guide Reliability & Adaptation
- Guides may be outdated, biased, or contain errors — they are “historical experience,” not absolute truth.  
- Use guides as starting points, not as strict rules.  
- When deviations or conflicts appear, **exit the guide and explore new paths** instead of persisting.  
- Record useful deviation points for later improvement of the guides.

</tool_response>
<tool_instruction>
Always inspect the `webpage accessibility tree` and `webpage interactive elements` after navigation to confirm the page loaded as expected. This step is crucial for verifying successful navigation and for preparing for subsequent interactions by ensuring the browser state is as anticipated.
</tool_instruction>

09. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================
Thought: I have successfully navigated to the GitLab login page. The `webpage interactive elements` show that the input field for "Username or primary email" has index `2` and the input field for "Password" has index `4`. The "Sign in" button has index `8`.

<webpage interactive elements>[SYSTEM INFO: History interactive elements removed for brevity]</webpage interactive elements>

</tool_response>
<tool_instruction>

</tool_instruction>

37. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================
Thought: I have received the updated `webpage accessibility tree` and `webpage interactive elements`. I need to extract the issue ID and title for all open issues.

Looking at the `webpage accessibility tree`, each issue is represented by a `listitem` with `level=1`. Inside each `listitem`, there's a `link` that contains the issue title, and a `StaticText` element that contains the issue ID (e.g., `#215`).

I will iterate through the `webpage accessibility tree` to find these `listitem` elements. For each `listitem`, I will extract the `link` text as the title and the `StaticText` containing '#' as the ID.

Let's refine the extraction logic. Each issue has the following structure:
```
                listitem '', level=1
                    generic ''
                        StaticText 'Issue'
                            InlineTextBox ''
                        link '[FEAT]: Custom model docs', focusable=True, url='http://the-agent-company.com:8929/root/sotopia/-/issues/215'
                            StaticText '[FEAT]: Custom model docs'
                                InlineTextBox ''
                    StaticText '#215 '
                        InlineTextBox ''
```
I need to find `listitem` elements. Within each `listitem`, I need to find a `link` whose text is the issue title, and a `StaticText` that starts with `#` for the issue ID.

I will write a Python script to parse the `webpage accessibility tree` and extract the required information.Thought: I have received the `webpage accessibility tree` and `webpage interactive elements`. My goal is to extract the ID and Title of all open issues.

From the `webpage accessibility tree`, I can observe a pattern for each issue:
- Each issue is contained within a `listitem` element with `level=1`.
- Inside this `listitem`, there is a `link` element whose text is the issue title. The `url` attribute of this link also contains the issue ID at the end.
- Immediately after this `link`, there is a `StaticText` element that contains the issue ID in the format `#ID`.

I will write a Python script to parse the `webpage accessibility tree` to extract these elements. I will iterate through the `webpage accessibility tree` and identify the `listitem` elements. For each `listitem`, I will look for the `link` that represents the issue title and the `StaticText` that contains the issue ID.

The `webpage accessibility tree` is a string. I need to parse it to extract the relevant information. I can use regular expressions or string manipulation to find the patterns.

Here's the plan:
1. Iterate through the lines of the `webpage accessibility tree`.
2. When a line containing "listitem '', level=1" is found, it marks the start of an issue entry.
3. Look for the next `link` that has a `url` containing `/-/issues/` and extract its text as the title.
4. Look for the next `StaticText` that starts with `#` and extract the number as the ID.
5. Store the extracted ID and Title in the "ID,Title" format.

Let's try to implement this logic with Python code.
