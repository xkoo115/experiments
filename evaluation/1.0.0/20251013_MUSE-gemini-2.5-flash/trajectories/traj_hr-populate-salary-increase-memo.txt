# ACTION #
During task execution, you can perform **Actions**, including:
1. **Tool Call**
2. **Python Code Execution**

## Action Output Format
1. **Tool Call**
When calling a tool, please output:
<tool_call>
{"name": "<function-name>", "arguments": <args-json-object>}
</tool_call>
- `<function-name>`: Tool function name
- `<args-json-object>`: Call arguments (JSON format)
- If multiple `<tool_call>` are output at once, only the first one will be executed; the rest will be ignored.

Available tool signatures are provided within the `<tools>` tag:
<tools>
{"type": "function", "function": {"name": "extract_image_content_by_gpt4o", "description": "Utilizes `gpt-4o` to interpret and extract content from local image files (e.g., PNG, JPEG). Highly effective for **scanned documents, image-based PDFs (post-conversion to image formats),** or visual data. For optimal extraction, craft precise queries. **Caution: While effective for general content, direct numerical or highly structured extraction from complex visual elements (e.g., tally marks, handwritten notes) may be imprecise; robust post-processing is often required. For multi-page documents, convert each page into a separate image and ensure *all* generated image pages are processed for complete data extraction.**", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"image_path": {"type": "string", "description": "Local image path."}, "query": {"type": "string", "description": "Query to the gpt-4o to get the image content."}}, "required": ["image_path", "query"]}}}

Element indices are dynamic and highly volatile; always verify the target element's existence and index using `browser_wait_and_get_update` immediately before clicking. Be aware that even with immediate updates, indices can shift in very dynamic UIs. Crucially, after clicking, always use `browser_wait_and_get_update` to immediately re-evaluate the page state and confirm the intended effect (e.g., UI changes, navigation). For navigation, `browser_go_to_url` is a more robust alternative when a direct URL is known. For form submissions or general action triggers, `browser_send_keys` with 'Enter' is often a more robust alternative, especially when direct clicking by index proves unreliable. Avoid clicking elements that are not currently visible or interactable.", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"index": {"type": "integer", "description": "The index number of the target element."}}, "required": ["index"]}}}

It cannot process content that is scrolled out of view or exists on other pages of a paginated list. While `accessibility tree` and `interactive elements` are primary for UI understanding, this visual tool can be a highly effective *primary* method for text extraction in challenging scenarios. **Crucially, for critical or structured data (e.g., IDs, specific names, numerical values), always cross-verify with or prefer extraction from the `webpage accessibility tree` as visual interpretation may introduce inaccuracies, especially for abbreviated or visually ambiguous elements.**", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"query": {"type": "string", "description": "Query to the VL model to get the browser page content."}}, "required": ["query"]}}}

The `webpage interactive elements` from its output are highly dynamic and should be used immediately. For verifying responses or dynamic updates, consider setting `seconds` to a value appropriate for expected latency (e.g., `seconds=1` for immediate state, longer for human-like response times). **This tool is a fundamental prerequisite for almost all subsequent browser interactions due to the highly dynamic nature of web UI element indices.**", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"seconds": {"type": "integer", "description": "The number of seconds to wait, the default is 3 seconds.", "default": 3}}, "required": []}}}

Complex shell features like command chaining (`&&`, `||`), pipes (`|`), I/O redirection (`>`, `>>`), and backgrounding (`&`) are often *not reliably interpreted by `run_cmd` directly* and can lead to unexpected behavior or errors (e.g., `SyntaxError`, `command not found`). For any non-trivial shell interaction or complex logic, *always prefer consolidating operations into a single Python script that uses `subprocess` for explicit control and robustness* over multiple `run_cmd` calls or complex shell syntax.** 3) Quote arguments containing spaces (`\"path with spaces\"`). 4) State changes (`cd`) do not persist across calls.", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"command": {"type": "string", "description": "command暂时没有参数描述"}}, "required": ["command"]}}}
</tools>

2. **Python Code Execution**
When executing Python code, please output:
<code>
... your code ...
</code>
- The working directory is `/workspace`
- Executing dangerous, destructive, or time-consuming code is prohibited.
- If both a **Tool Call** and **Python Code Execution** are included in the output, the tool call takes precedence, and the Python code will not be executed.
- Using outdated or limited python libraries may result in incomplete or inaccurate observations (e.g. missing images from PDFs or failing to extract key content). Always prefer robust, modern libraries to ensure full and reliable results.
- When performing file conversion or data extraction, always ensure **data integrity**. Verify that the structure, content, and critical fields of the source file are preserved in the output. Check row and column counts, headers, and key values before and after processing. **Avoid silent loss**, truncation, or unintended alteration of data.

## Action Execution Result Processing
- After each action is executed, an Observation is returned, which includes:
    1. `<tool_response>`: The result of the tool or code execution.
    2. `<tool_instruction>`: The instruction associated with a specific action, used to guide the next step or restrict subsequent behavior.
- **Note**: Do not fabricate observations.

## Security and Restrictions
- **Coding Actions (such as Python, CMD, etc.)**
    - Do not run high-risk operations that are large in code size or take a long time.
    - Do not execute code that could cause data loss, system damage, or irreversible changes.
    - Do not use the kill command with wildcards like * or other dangerous parameters that could result in a wide range of matches.
    - Prefer using the Python interpreter to execute code (safer and more efficient) rather than using the CMD tool.

> ⚠️ **Important**
> When your output contains content that fully conforms to the **Tool Call** or **Python Code Execution** format, the system will immediately parse, identify, and execute it as an **Action** without further confirmation and without reversal.
> Therefore, before outputting, always confirm that this is your **intended** action and fully assess the potential consequences and risks.
> If you are only using **quotes, demonstrations, or examples**, be sure to break the formatting or escape it to prevent the system from interpreting it as a real action.

# OBJECTIVE #
Your core objective is to independently and efficiently complete the tasks assigned to you by the company.


# MEMORY #
During previous tasks, you have accumulated the following reusable knowledge:

## Resolution Patterns
Comprehensive Contextualization: Systematically acquire and aggregate information from diverse, potentially unstructured sources, prioritizing local processing and cross-validation, to ensure a complete, coherent operational view and inform robust decisions.
Robust External Interaction: Prioritize stable, predictable interaction methods, such as structured APIs, and dynamically adapt strategies to ensure continuity and reliability with external systems despite their inconsistencies or volatility.
Adaptive Constraint Handling: When an objective is blocked by an unresolvable external constraint, acknowledge the limitation, perform necessary cleanup of partial artifacts, and adapt the strategy to proceed with viable data, avoiding unproductive retries.
Modular Resilient Design: Decompose operations into modular, decoupled units with explicit state management, to enhance predictability, isolate errors, improve maintainability, and ensure operational continuity.
Progressive Verification: Implement multi-stage validation, from granular checks within pipelines to comprehensive outcome validation, to localize errors, confirm system states, and ensure successful execution.

## Platform/Application Operation Guides
These guides summarize proven operation paths derived from past successful experiences.  
Each item is a structured reference designed to help you complete operations more quickly, accurately, and with reduced redundancy.

> This directory provides a comprehensive index of guides, compiling best practices and experience summaries for accomplishing various tasks.

### Recommended Usage Process
1. **Review the Guide First**  
   Before starting a task, browse the relevant entries in the directory to identify potentially useful guidance.  
2. **Targeted Access**  
   Use the `access_the_application_guide` tool to view detailed steps if necessary.  
3. **Reuse with Flexibility**  
   Apply past successful steps when they fit the current situation, but stay aware of possible mismatches.  
4. **Explore When Deviations Arise**  
   If the environment or results diverge from the guide, stop rigidly following it and explore alternative approaches through small, safe, and adaptive steps.

### Value of Guides
- Reduce task completion time by leveraging accumulated experience.  
- Lower error rates and avoid common pitfalls.  
- Ensure consistent, professional execution of tasks.  

### Guide Reliability & Adaptation
- Guides may be outdated, biased, or contain errors — they are “historical experience,” not absolute truth.  
- Use guides as starting points, not as strict rules.  
- When deviations or conflicts appear, **exit the guide and explore new paths** instead of persisting.  
- Record useful deviation points for later improvement of the guides.

If an `Element index does not exist` error is returned, it indicates extreme element volatility. **Always re-evaluate `webpage interactive elements` with `browser_wait_and_get_update` immediately before attempting a click, and crucially, confirm the element's `text` or `aria-label` attribute semantically matches the intended target.** If direct clicking by index proves unreliable, *especially within dynamic lists or sidebars (e.g., chat contact lists)*, consider alternative strategies like using an application's built-in search functionality or `browser_go_to_url` if a direct link is known, rather than repeatedly retrying. For form submissions or general action triggers, `browser_send_keys` with 'Enter' is a more robust alternative and **highly recommended for reliability**.

## Verification Report for Subtask: Login to ownCloud

**Title**: Verification of ownCloud Login Completion

**Checklist Details**:

1.  **Check Step**: `verify_url_after_login`
    *   **Goal**: Confirm that the browser's current URL indicates a successful login to the ownCloud files application, matching the expected URL pattern (e.g., ending with '/index.php/apps/files/').
    *   **Outcome**: **PASSED**. As per `Observation 11`, the URL after login was `http://the-agent-company.com:8092/index.php/apps/files/?dir=%2F&fileid=5`, which clearly shows the agent has successfully navigated to the ownCloud files application.

2.  **Check Step**: `verify_post_login_ui_elements`
    *   **Goal**: Examine the `webpage accessibility tree` and `webpage interactive elements` to confirm the presence of elements typical of a logged-in state (e.g., 'Files' heading, file/folder listings like 'Documents', 'Downloads') and the absence of login-specific elements (e.g., username/password input fields, login button) that would indicate the login form is still present.
    *   **Outcome**: **PASSED**.
        *   `Observation 11` and `Observation 13` show the `RootWebArea` title as 'Files - ownCloud', a `heading 'Files', level=1`, and links for 'theagentcompany', 'Documents', 'Downloads', 'Photos', 'Talk', 'Templates', and 'ownCloud Manual .pdf', which are all indicative of a successfully logged-in state within the file management interface.
        *   Conversely, the login-specific interactive elements (username input, password input, and login button) observed in `Observation 5` are entirely absent in `Observation 11` and `Observation 13`, confirming that the login form is no longer present.

**Conclusion**:
The Task Agent has successfully completed the "Login to ownCloud" subtask. All verification checks confirm that the agent is logged into the ownCloud files application, as evidenced by the URL and the presence/absence of key UI elements.

## Verification Report for Subtask: Download salary_increase.txt

**Title**: Verification of 'salary_increase.txt' Download Completion

**Checklist Details**:

1.  **Check Step**: `verify_local_file_existence`
    *   **Goal**: Confirm that 'salary_increase.txt' exists in the '/workspace' directory.
    *   **Outcome**: **PASSED**. As per `Observation 1` of the verification steps, the command `ls -l /workspace/salary_increase.txt` executed successfully with `returncode: 0` and listed the file, confirming its existence in the `/workspace` directory.

2.  **Check Step**: `verify_local_file_content_and_size`
    *   **Goal**: Check the content of the downloaded 'salary_increase.txt' in '/workspace' and verify its size matches the reported size from the download operation (818 bytes).
    *   **Outcome**: **PASSED**.
        *   **Size Verification**: `Observation 1` of the verification steps shows the file size as `818` bytes, which precisely matches the size (`[818/818]`) reported in the Task Agent's `wget` output (`Observation 05` of the Task Agent's trajectory).
        *   **Content Verification**: `Observation 2` of the verification steps, from the `cat /workspace/salary_increase.txt` command, successfully displayed the content of the file. The content appears to be well-formed CSV-like data, beginning with a header `Name,Job Title,Current Salary,Percentage Increase,New Salary,Email`, indicating a successful and intact download of the intended text file.

**Conclusion**:
The Task Agent has successfully completed the "Download salary_increase.txt" subtask. The file 'salary_increase.txt' is present in the local `/workspace` directory, its size matches the download report, and its content is readable and consistent with the expected data.

## Verification Report for Subtask: Read employee data from salary_increase.txt

**Title**: Verification of Employee Data Extraction and Parsing Completion

**Checklist Details**:

1.  **Check Step**: `verify_employee_data_structure_and_completeness`
    *   **Goal**: Confirm that the final `stdout` from the Task Agent's Python script (Observation 13) contains a list of dictionaries, each with the required keys (`name`, `email`, `salary_amount`, `assignment_start_date`, `assignment_end_date`), and that the number of extracted employee records matches the original `salary_increase.txt` content.
    *   **Outcome**: **PASSED**. The verification script confirmed that the `stdout` from Observation 13 parsed into a list of 10 dictionaries. Each dictionary contained all 5 required keys. The record count of 10 perfectly matches the 10 data rows in the original `salary_increase.txt` (Observation 05), confirming both structure and completeness.

2.  **Check Step**: `verify_extracted_data_accuracy`
    *   **Goal**: Verify that the `name`, `email`, and `salary_amount` values for a representative sample of employees from the extracted data (Observation 13) accurately match the corresponding data in the original `salary_increase.txt` content (Observation 05).
    *   **Outcome**: **PASSED**. A sample of three employee records was compared. For each sampled employee, the extracted `name`, `email`, and `salary_amount` values from Observation 13 were found to be identical to their counterparts in the original `salary_increase.txt` content from Observation 05, indicating accurate data extraction.

3.  **Check Step**: `verify_placeholder_dates`
    *   **Goal**: Confirm that the `assignment_start_date` for all extracted employee records is consistently '2024-01-01' and `assignment_end_date` is consistently '2024-12-31', as specified by the Task Agent's logic.
    *   **Outcome**: **PASSED**. The verification script confirmed that for all extracted employee records, the `assignment_start_date` was uniformly '2024-01-01' and the `assignment_end_date` was uniformly '2024-12-31', matching the placeholder values intended by the Task Agent.

**Conclusion**:
The Task Agent has successfully completed the "Read employee data from salary_increase.txt" subtask. All verification checks confirm that employee data has been correctly extracted and parsed from the `salary_increase.txt` file, adhering to the specified data structure, accuracy, and placeholder date requirements.

SubTask6: Create salary_increase_notice folder
Goal: A new folder named 'salary_increase_notice' is successfully created inside 'Documents/Human Resources Team' in ownCloud.
73. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================
Thought: I need to create a new folder named `salary_increase_notice` inside `Documents/Human Resources Team` in ownCloud. There isn't a specific guide for creating folders in ownCloud. However, ownCloud supports WebDAV, and I can use `curl` with the `MKCOL` method to create a directory. I will access the `System - ExecuteShellCommand` guide for general shell command execution.

Thought: I have accessed the `System - ExecuteShellCommand` guide. I need to create a directory in ownCloud using WebDAV. The WebDAV `MKCOL` method is used for this purpose. The URL for creating a folder will be `http://the-agent-company.com:8092/remote.php/webdav/Documents/Human%20Resources%20Team/salary_increase_notice`. I will use `curl` with the `-X MKCOL` option and provide the ownCloud credentials.

Always check `command_result.returncode`: `0` indicates success; non-zero suggests an error; analyze `command_result.stderr`. For successful commands, process `command_result.stdout`. *Note: `command_result.stderr` may contain non-error information; evaluate contextually.* **Crucially, for any sequence of shell commands or when integrating shell output with Python logic, *always encapsulate the entire interaction within a single Python script using `subprocess`* for maximum robustness and control, rather than relying on discrete `run_cmd` calls or shell features like redirection.**

Thought: The `run_cmd` command to create the directory returned a `returncode` of 0, which signifies success. The `stderr` output confirms that the `curl` command executed without errors. This indicates that the `salary_increase_notice` folder has been successfully created inside `Documents/Human Resources Team` in ownCloud.

## Verification Report for Subtask: Create salary_increase_notice folder

**Title**: Verification of 'salary_increase_notice' Folder Creation Completion

**Checklist Details**:

1.  **Check Step**: `verify_curl_command_result`
    *   **Goal**: Confirm that the `curl -X MKCOL` command executed by the Task Agent returned a `returncode` of 0, indicating successful execution, and that its `stderr` did not contain any error messages preventing folder creation.
    *   **Outcome**: **PASSED**. As per `Observation 05` of the Task Agent's trajectory, the `curl -X MKCOL` command returned a `returncode` of `0`. The `stderr` contained only `curl`'s progress output and no error messages, confirming the command executed successfully without issues.

2.  **Check Step**: `verify_folder_in_webdav`
    *   **Goal**: Proactively query the ownCloud server using a WebDAV `PROPFIND` request on the 'Documents/Human Resources Team' directory to confirm that 'salary_increase_notice' is listed as an existing folder within its contents.
    *   **Outcome**: **PASSED**. The `PROPFIND` command executed by the verification agent returned a `returncode` of 0 (Observation 01 in the verification process). The `stdout` from this command contained an XML response which included the entry `<d:response><d:href>/remote.php/webdav/Documents/Human%20Resources%20Team/salary_increase_notice/</d:href><d:propstat><d:prop><d:resourcetype><d:collection/></d:resourcetype></d:prop><d:status>HTTP/1.1 200 OK</d:status></d:propstat></d:response>`, confirming the existence of a collection (folder) named `salary_increase_notice` within the specified path on ownCloud.

**Conclusion**:
The Task Agent has successfully completed the "Create salary_increase_notice folder" subtask. Both the execution of the folder creation command and the subsequent verification of the folder's existence on the ownCloud server have been confirmed.

Thought: The previous attempt to upload files failed because the `remote_filepath` was not properly URL-encoded, leading to a "URL using bad/illegal format or missing URL" error from `curl`. The spaces in "Human Resources Team" were causing the issue. I need to use `urllib.parse.quote` to correctly encode the `remote_folder_path` before constructing the full `remote_filepath` for the `curl` command. I will then re-execute the Python script with this fix.

Thought: The Python script successfully created local MEMO files for each employee and then uploaded them to ownCloud. The output clearly states "Successfully created local file" and "Successfully uploaded ... to ownCloud" for every employee, with `curl`'s `stderr` showing successful transfers. This indicates that all individual MEMOs have been populated, saved locally, and subsequently uploaded to the designated `salary_increase_notice` folder in ownCloud. Therefore, this subtask is complete.
Final Answer: For each employee, a personalized MEMO based on 'Salary_Increase_MEMO.odt' is created locally with their specific data and then uploaded as a separate file to the 'salary_increase_notice' folder in ownCloud.

## Verification Report for Subtask: Populate and save individual MEMOs

**Title**: Verification of Individual MEMO Population and Upload Completion

**Checklist Details**:

1.  **Check Step**: `verify_local_file_creation_count`
    *   **Goal**: Confirm that exactly 10 local MEMO files, named according to the pattern 'Salary_Increase_MEMO\_<EmployeeName>.odt', exist in the '/workspace' directory.
    *   **Outcome**: **PASSED**. A Python script executed by the verification agent (Observation 02) reported "Number of MEMO files: 10", confirming the creation of 10 local MEMO files, one for each employee.

2.  **Check Step**: `verify_sample_local_file_content`
    *   **Goal**: Select a representative local MEMO file (e.g., 'Salary_Increase_MEMO\_John\_Doe.odt') and verify that its content is correctly populated with the specific employee's data (name, email, salary amount, assignment start date, assignment end date) as per the template.
    *   **Outcome**: **PASSED**. The content of `/workspace/Salary_Increase_MEMO_John_Doe.odt` was retrieved (Observation 04) and confirmed to be correctly populated with John Doe's specific details, including name, email, new annual salary ($93,500.00), assignment start date (2024-01-01), and assignment end date (2024-12-31), matching the expected data and template.

3.  **Check Step**: `verify_remote_file_upload_and_count`
    *   **Goal**: Proactively query the ownCloud server using a WebDAV `PROPFIND` request on the 'Documents/Human Resources Team/salary_increase_notice' directory to confirm that exactly 10 files with names matching the 'Salary_Increase_MEMO\_<EmployeeName>.odt' pattern are present, indicating successful upload for all employees.
    *   **Outcome**: **PASSED**. A `curl PROPFIND` command executed by the verification agent (Observation 05) successfully queried the ownCloud directory. The `stdout` XML output contained 10 `<d:response>` elements, each corresponding to a unique 'Salary_Increase_MEMO\_<EmployeeName>.odt' file (e.g., `Salary_Increase_MEMO_John_Doe.odt`, `Salary_Increase_MEMO_Jane_Smith.odt`, etc.), confirming that all 10 personalized MEMOs were successfully uploaded to the target folder in ownCloud.

**Conclusion**:
The Task Agent has successfully completed the "Populate and save individual MEMOs" subtask. All verification checks confirm that personalized MEMO files were correctly created locally for each employee, their content was accurately populated, and all 10 files were successfully uploaded to the designated 'salary_increase_notice' folder in ownCloud.

Please comprehensively review the entire task execution process, including all subtasks and the contextual information collected.  
Cross-check carefully against the overall task requirements:

1. **Completeness Check**: Ensure every aspect of the requirements has been addressed. Confirm that no items were skipped, postponed, or only partially completed.  
2. **Consistency Check**: Verify that all intermediate results are logically coherent and data-wise consistent with the final conclusions. There should be no contradictions, missing steps, or unexplained gaps.  
3. **Final Completion Confirmation**:  
   - If any requirements remain unfinished or results are insufficient, explicitly list the next subtasks to resolve them.  
   - If all requirements are fully and correctly met, return an empty task plan to indicate the task is completely finished.  

Always remember that your ultimate goal is to complete task:
<task>
Navigate to owncloud at http://the-agent-company.com:8092. Create a MEMO template for staff salary increase that can be used every year, named as "Salary_Increase_MEMO.odt" and saved in "Documents/Human Resources Team", including name, email, salary amount, assignment start and end date. Populate the MEMO information from the salary_increase.txt in "Documents/Human Resources Team" for each of the employees. The populated MEMO should be saved under folder named "salary_increase_notice" in the same hr folder.

* The information you know and have obtained is:
    1. **Overall Task**: Navigate to owncloud at `http://the-agent-company.com:8092`. Create a MEMO template for staff salary increase that can be used every year, named as "Salary_Increase_MEMO.odt" and saved in "Documents/Human Resources Team", including name, email, salary amount, assignment start and end date. Populate the MEMO information from the `salary_increase.txt` in "Documents/Human Resources Team" for each of the employees. The populated MEMO should be saved under folder named "salary_increase_notice" in the same hr folder.
    2. **ownCloud Access**: Successfully logged into ownCloud using `http://the-agent-company.com:8092` with username `theagentcompany` and password `theagentcompany`.
    3. **Navigation to HR Folder**: Successfully navigated to the 'Documents/Human Resources Team' folder within ownCloud.
    4. **MEMO Template Creation and Upload**: A template file named 'Salary_Increase_MEMO.odt' containing placeholders for `name`, `email`, `salary amount`, `assignment start date`, and `assignment end date` was created locally and successfully uploaded to 'Documents/Human Resources Team'.
    5. **Data File Download**: The `salary_increase.txt` file was successfully downloaded from 'Documents/Human Resources Team' to the local workspace (`/workspace/salary_increase.txt`).
    6. **Employee Data Extraction**: Employee data (name, email, salary amount, assignment start date, assignment end date) was successfully extracted and parsed from the local `salary_increase.txt` file. Placeholder dates ('2024-01-01' and '2024-12-31') were used for assignment start and end dates as they were not present in the source file. The data is stored in the `employee_data` variable as a list of dictionaries.
    7. **Target Folder Creation**: A new folder named 'salary_increase_notice' was successfully created inside 'Documents/Human Resources Team' in ownCloud.
    8. **Individual MEMO Generation and Upload**: For each employee, a personalized MEMO based on the 'Salary_Increase_MEMO.odt' template was created locally with their specific data and then successfully uploaded as a separate file to the 'salary_increase_notice' folder in ownCloud. All 10 employee MEMOs were processed, saved, and uploaded.
