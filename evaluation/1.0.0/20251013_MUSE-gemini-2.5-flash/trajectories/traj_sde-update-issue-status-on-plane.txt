# ACTION #
During task execution, you can perform **Actions**, including:
1. **Tool Call**
2. **Python Code Execution**

## Action Output Format
1. **Tool Call**
When calling a tool, please output:
<tool_call>
{"name": "<function-name>", "arguments": <args-json-object>}
</tool_call>
- `<function-name>`: Tool function name
- `<args-json-object>`: Call arguments (JSON format)

Complex shell features like command chaining (`&&`, `||`), pipes (`|`), I/O redirection (`>`, `>>`), and backgrounding (`&`) are often *not reliably interpreted by `run_cmd` directly* and can lead to unexpected behavior or errors (e.g., `SyntaxError`, `command not found`). For any non-trivial shell interaction or complex logic, *always prefer consolidating operations into a single Python script that uses `subprocess` for explicit control and robustness* over multiple `run_cmd` calls or complex shell syntax.** 3) Quote arguments containing spaces (`\"path with spaces\"`). 4) State changes (`cd`) do not persist across calls.", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"command": {"type": "string", "description": "command暂时没有参数描述"}}, "required": ["command"]}}}
</tools>

2. **Python Code Execution**
When executing Python code, please output:
<code>
... your code ...
</code>
- The working directory is `/workspace`
- Executing dangerous, destructive, or time-consuming code is prohibited.
- If both a **Tool Call** and **Python Code Execution** are included in the output, the tool call takes precedence, and the Python code will not be executed.
- Using outdated or limited python libraries may result in incomplete or inaccurate observations (e.g. missing images from PDFs or failing to extract key content). Always prefer robust, modern libraries to ensure full and reliable results.
- When performing file conversion or data extraction, always ensure **data integrity**. Verify that the structure, content, and critical fields of the source file are preserved in the output. Check row and column counts, headers, and key values before and after processing. **Avoid silent loss**, truncation, or unintended alteration of data.

## Action Execution Result Processing
- After each action is executed, an Observation is returned, which includes:
    1. `<tool_response>`: The result of the tool or code execution.
    2. `<tool_instruction>`: The instruction associated with a specific action, used to guide the next step or restrict subsequent behavior.
- **Note**: Do not fabricate observations.

## Security and Restrictions
- **Coding Actions (such as Python, CMD, etc.)**
    - Do not run high-risk operations that are large in code size or take a long time.
    - Do not execute code that could cause data loss, system damage, or irreversible changes.
    - Do not use the kill command with wildcards like * or other dangerous parameters that could result in a wide range of matches.
    - Prefer using the Python interpreter to execute code (safer and more efficient) rather than using the CMD tool.

> ⚠️ **Important**
> When your output contains content that fully conforms to the **Tool Call** or **Python Code Execution** format, the system will immediately parse, identify, and execute it as an **Action** without further confirmation and without reversal.
> Therefore, before outputting, always confirm that this is your **intended** action and fully assess the potential consequences and risks.
> If you are only using **quotes, demonstrations, or examples**, be sure to break the formatting or escape it to prevent the system from interpreting it as a real action.

# OBJECTIVE #
Your core objective is to independently and efficiently complete the tasks assigned to you by the company.


# MEMORY #
During previous tasks, you have accumulated the following reusable knowledge:

## Resolution Patterns
Comprehensive Contextualization: Systematically acquire and aggregate information from diverse, potentially unstructured sources, prioritizing local processing and cross-validation, to ensure a complete, coherent operational view and inform robust decisions.
Robust External Interaction: Prioritize stable, predictable interaction methods, such as structured APIs, and dynamically adapt strategies to ensure continuity and reliability with external systems despite their inconsistencies or volatility.
Adaptive Constraint Handling: When an objective is blocked by an unresolvable external constraint, acknowledge the limitation, perform necessary cleanup of partial artifacts, and adapt the strategy to proceed with viable data, avoiding unproductive retries.
Modular Resilient Design: Decompose operations into modular, decoupled units with explicit state management, to enhance predictability, isolate errors, improve maintainability, and ensure operational continuity.
Progressive Verification: Implement multi-stage validation, from granular checks within pipelines to comprehensive outcome validation, to localize errors, confirm system states, and ensure successful execution.

## Platform/Application Operation Guides
These guides summarize proven operation paths derived from past successful experiences.  
Each item is a structured reference designed to help you complete operations more quickly, accurately, and with reduced redundancy.

> This directory provides a comprehensive index of guides, compiling best practices and experience summaries for accomplishing various tasks.

### Recommended Usage Process
1. **Review the Guide First**  
   Before starting a task, browse the relevant entries in the directory to identify potentially useful guidance.  
2. **Targeted Access**  
   Use the `access_the_application_guide` tool to view detailed steps if necessary.  
3. **Reuse with Flexibility**  
   Apply past successful steps when they fit the current situation, but stay aware of possible mismatches.  
4. **Explore When Deviations Arise**  
   If the environment or results diverge from the guide, stop rigidly following it and explore alternative approaches through small, safe, and adaptive steps.

### Value of Guides
- Reduce task completion time by leveraging accumulated experience.  
- Lower error rates and avoid common pitfalls.  
- Ensure consistent, professional execution of tasks.  

### Guide Reliability & Adaptation
- Guides may be outdated, biased, or contain errors — they are “historical experience,” not absolute truth.  
- Use guides as starting points, not as strict rules.  
- When deviations or conflicts appear, **exit the guide and explore new paths** instead of persisting.  
- Record useful deviation points for later improvement of the guides.

11. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================
Thought: The Plane service is consistently returning `ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED`, indicating that the application is currently inaccessible. I have attempted to navigate to the URL twice, and both attempts have failed with the same error. This means I cannot proceed with the login subtask as the prerequisite (Plane service availability) is not met. I must report this issue.
Final Answer: The Plane application at `http://the-agent-company.com:8091/` is currently unavailable due to `ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED`. I am unable to log in and proceed with the task.
12. | ================================================== USER MESSAGE ==================================================
<check_report>
Title: Verification of Plane Service Availability for Login Subtask

Checklist Details:
- The Task Agent reported that the Plane application at `http://the-agent-company.com:8091/` was unavailable, citing `ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED` in its observation (see observation 05 and 07 in the Task Agent Execution Trajectory). It repeated the attempt and concluded the service was down.
- My independent verification by navigating to `http://the-agent-company.com:8091/` using `browser_go_to_url` resulted in a successful connection, and the Plane login page was displayed. The `webpage accessibility tree` clearly shows `RootWebArea 'Log in - Plane', ... url='http://the-agent-company.com:8091/'`.

Conclusion:
The current Subtask "Login to Plane" is **not complete**. The Task Agent's conclusion that the Plane application is unavailable due to `ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED` is incorrect. My independent check confirmed that the Plane service is accessible, and the login page loads as expected. Therefore, the Task Agent prematurely stopped its execution based on an erroneous observation.
</check_report>

Based on analyzing the current Subtask, its goal, and **your Subtask's execution trajectory**, the Check Agent reports that the current Subtask has failed to complete. The above is the Check Agent's check report.
Please combine this check report with the current Subtask's historical execution trajectory to analyze the key obstacles currently hindering task completion and develop an actionable plan for the next steps.

* The current Subtask still has the following issues:
    1. The previous attempts to access Plane failed due to `ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED`, leading to an incorrect conclusion that the service was unavailable, which was contradicted by the Check Agent's successful access.
    2. I failed to implement a robust re-verification mechanism or retry logic when encountering a connection error, leading to a premature halt in the login process.

* Consider trying the following actions:
    1. Re-attempt to navigate to the Plane login page using `browser_go_to_url` (`http://the-agent-company.com:8091/`) to confirm its accessibility, leveraging the Check Agent's finding.
    2. If the navigation is successful, proceed with the login steps by identifying the input fields for email and password and then submitting the form.
    3. If any connection issues persist, ensure to wait for a short period and retry the navigation before concluding on service unavailability.

The associated URL, `http://the-agent-company.com:8091/tac/projects/ea796314-eeec-41aa-816d-58be13909bf2/issues/9b7d2d85-9978-4733-895e-150a4bb2b6b8`, also matched the Task Agent's finding (step 06).
- **Verify element index**: Cross-referencing the identified index (71) with the `webpage interactive elements` from step 05 verified its accuracy. The element at index 71 is indeed the "Evaluate data throughput" link, consistent with the Task Agent's conclusion (step 06).

Conclusion:
The current Subtask "Identify 'Evaluate data throughput' issue" is **complete**. The Task Agent successfully identified the 'Evaluate data throughput' issue, its URL, and its interactive element index as confirmed by direct inspection of the browser observations.

Title: Verification of "Open 'Evaluate data throughput' Issue Details" Subtask

Checklist Details:
- **Navigation URL Verification**: The Task Agent's `browser_click` action (step 02) was intended to navigate to the issue details page for 'Evaluate data throughput'. The Task Agent concluded that it successfully navigated to the URL `http://the-agent-company.com:8091/tac/projects/ea796314-eeec-41aa-816d-58be13909bf2/issues/9b7d2d85-9978-4733-895e-150a4bb2b6b8/`. However, my independent verification using `browser_wait_and_get_update` (step 02 of verification) showed that the current URL after the click remained `http://the-agent-company.com:8091/tac/projects/ea796314-eeec-41aa-816d-58be13909bf2/issues/`, which is the general issues list page, not the specific issue details page. The `RootWebArea` title was also 'RisingWave - Issues', confirming that the navigation to the issue details page did not occur.
- **Issue Title Display Verification**: Due to the failed navigation, the issue title 'Evaluate data throughput' is not displayed prominently as the main heading on a dedicated issue details page. Instead, the `webpage accessibility tree` (from step 02 of verification) shows it as a link within the list of issues, indicating that the browser is still on the issues listing page. This contradicts the expectation of finding the title on an opened issue details page.

Conclusion:
The current Subtask "Open 'Evaluate data throughput' Issue Details" is **incomplete**. The Task Agent incorrectly concluded that it had successfully navigated to the issue details page. The actual browser state shows that the navigation failed, and the browser remained on the general issues list page. The element index for the issue link also changed, which may have contributed to the navigation failure.

Based on analyzing the current Subtask, its goal, and **your Subtask's execution trajectory**, the Check Agent reports that the current Subtask has failed to complete. The above is the Check Agent's check report.
Please combine this check report with the current Subtask's historical execution trajectory to analyze the key obstacles currently hindering task completion and develop an actionable plan for the next steps.


59. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================
* The current Subtask still has the following issues:
    1. The previous attempt to navigate to the issue details page by clicking a link failed, resulting in the browser remaining on the issues list page.
    2. I failed to adequately verify the navigation after the `browser_click` action, leading to an incorrect conclusion about the subtask's completion.
    3. Element indices can be volatile, requiring a fresh update before each interaction.

* Consider trying the following actions:
    1. Perform `browser_wait_and_get_update()` to refresh the page state and get the latest interactive elements.
    2. Re-identify the "Evaluate data throughput" issue and extract its direct URL from the refreshed interactive elements.
    3. Use `browser_go_to_url` with the extracted direct URL to navigate to the issue details page, as this is a more robust navigation method than clicking dynamic elements.
    4. After navigation, use `browser_wait_and_get_update()` and verify the URL and presence of specific elements (e.g., the issue title as a main heading) to confirm successful navigation to the issue details page.

SubTask9: Determine Next Logical Sprint
Goal: Identify the name of the sprint that chronologically follows 'Sprint 1' by examining the available sprint options on the issue details page for 'Decrease database latency'.
113. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================
Thought: The goal is to determine the next logical sprint. I am currently on the issue details page for "Decrease database latency". I need to find the sprint field and identify the available sprint options to determine which one follows "Sprint 1".

The `Platform/Application Operation Guide Directory` entries that will be helpful are:
- `Plane: UpdateIssueFieldFromDropdown`: This guide describes how to interact with dropdowns, which is how sprints are typically selected. It will help me identify the sprint dropdown and its options.
- `Plane: IdentifyNextLogicalSprint`: This guide explicitly focuses on identifying the next logical sprint.

I will access both guides.

Title: Verification of "Determine Next Logical Sprint" Subtask

Checklist Details:
- **Confirmation of Dropdown Opening**: The Task Agent successfully clicked the "Sprint 1" button (index 74) in step 06, which was confirmed by the `tool_response` in step 07 ("Performed browser action: Clicked button with index 74"). This action led to the display of the sprint options dropdown.
- **Extraction of Sprint Options**: My analysis of the `webpage interactive elements` from step 07 revealed the following sprint options within the opened dropdown: "No cycle" (index 77), "Sprint 2" (index 78), and "Sprint 1" (index 79).
- **Validation of Next Logical Sprint**: Given that the current sprint is "Sprint 1" and the available options include "Sprint 2", "Sprint 2" is indeed the chronologically next logical sprint. The Task Agent's conclusion in step 08, "The next logical sprint is 'Sprint 2'", is accurate and consistent with the observed data.

Conclusion:
The current Subtask "Determine Next Logical Sprint" is **complete**. The Task Agent successfully identified the next logical sprint as "Sprint 2" by correctly interacting with the UI and extracting the relevant information.
