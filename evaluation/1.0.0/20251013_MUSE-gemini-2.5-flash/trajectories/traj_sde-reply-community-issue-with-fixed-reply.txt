The `webpage interactive elements` from its output are highly dynamic and should be used immediately. For verifying responses or dynamic updates, consider setting `seconds` to a value appropriate for expected latency (e.g., `seconds=1` for immediate state, longer for human-like response times). **This tool is a fundamental prerequisite for almost all subsequent browser interactions due to the highly dynamic nature of web UI element indices.**", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"seconds": {"type": "integer", "description": "The number of seconds to wait, the default is 3 seconds.", "default": 3}}, "required": []}}}

Returns a JSON object with `execution_status`, `returncode`, `stdout`, and `stderr`. **Important Precautions**: 1) `returncode=0` does not guarantee successful side effects (e.g., file creation); always verify with independent checks (`ls -l`, `file`). 2) **This tool executes commands in a *minimal* shell environment. Complex shell features like command chaining (`&&`, `||`), pipes (`|`), I/O redirection (`>`, `>>`), and backgrounding (`&`) are often *not reliably interpreted by `run_cmd` directly* and can lead to unexpected behavior or errors (e.g., `SyntaxError`, `command not found`). For any non-trivial shell interaction or complex logic, *always prefer consolidating operations into a single Python script that uses `subprocess` for explicit control and robustness* over multiple `run_cmd` calls or complex shell syntax.** 3) Quote arguments containing spaces (`\"path with spaces\"`). 4) State changes (`cd`) do not persist across calls.", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"command": {"type": "string", "description": "command暂时没有参数描述"}}, "required": ["command"]}}}
</tools>

2. **Python Code Execution**
When executing Python code, please output:
<code>
... your code ...
</code>
- The working directory is `/workspace`
- Executing dangerous, destructive, or time-consuming code is prohibited.
- If both a **Tool Call** and **Python Code Execution** are included in the output, the tool call takes precedence, and the Python code will not be executed.
- Using outdated or limited python libraries may result in incomplete or inaccurate observations (e.g. missing images from PDFs or failing to extract key content). Always prefer robust, modern libraries to ensure full and reliable results.
- When performing file conversion or data extraction, always ensure **data integrity**. Verify that the structure, content, and critical fields of the source file are preserved in the output. Check row and column counts, headers, and key values before and after processing. **Avoid silent loss**, truncation, or unintended alteration of data.

## Action Execution Result Processing
- After each action is executed, an Observation is returned, which includes:
    1. `<tool_response>`: The result of the tool or code execution.
    2. `<tool_instruction>`: The instruction associated with a specific action, used to guide the next step or restrict subsequent behavior.
- **Note**: Do not fabricate observations.

## Security and Restrictions
- **Coding Actions (such as Python, CMD, etc.)**
    - Do not run high-risk operations that are large in code size or take a long time.
    - Do not execute code that could cause data loss, system damage, or irreversible changes.
    - Do not use the kill command with wildcards like * or other dangerous parameters that could result in a wide range of matches.
    - Prefer using the Python interpreter to execute code (safer and more efficient) rather than using the CMD tool.

> ⚠️ **Important**
> When your output contains content that fully conforms to the **Tool Call** or **Python Code Execution** format, the system will immediately parse, identify, and execute it as an **Action** without further confirmation and without reversal.
> Therefore, before outputting, always confirm that this is your **intended** action and fully assess the potential consequences and risks.
> If you are only using **quotes, demonstrations, or examples**, be sure to break the formatting or escape it to prevent the system from interpreting it as a real action.

# OBJECTIVE #
Your core objective is to independently and efficiently complete the tasks assigned to you by the company.


# MEMORY #
During previous tasks, you have accumulated the following reusable knowledge:

## Resolution Patterns
Comprehensive Contextualization: Systematically acquire and aggregate information from diverse, potentially unstructured sources, prioritizing local processing and cross-validation, to ensure a complete, coherent operational view and inform robust decisions.
Robust External Interaction: Prioritize stable, predictable interaction methods, such as structured APIs, and dynamically adapt strategies to ensure continuity and reliability with external systems despite their inconsistencies or volatility.
Adaptive Constraint Handling: When an objective is blocked by an unresolvable external constraint, acknowledge the limitation, perform necessary cleanup of partial artifacts, and adapt the strategy to proceed with viable data, avoiding unproductive retries.
Modular Resilient Design: Decompose operations into modular, decoupled units with explicit state management, to enhance predictability, isolate errors, improve maintainability, and ensure operational continuity.
Progressive Verification: Implement multi-stage validation, from granular checks within pipelines to comprehensive outcome validation, to localize errors, confirm system states, and ensure successful execution.

## Platform/Application Operation Guides
These guides summarize proven operation paths derived from past successful experiences.  
Each item is a structured reference designed to help you complete operations more quickly, accurately, and with reduced redundancy.

> This directory provides a comprehensive index of guides, compiling best practices and experience summaries for accomplishing various tasks.

### Recommended Usage Process
1. **Review the Guide First**  
   Before starting a task, browse the relevant entries in the directory to identify potentially useful guidance.  
2. **Targeted Access**  
   Use the `access_the_application_guide` tool to view detailed steps if necessary.  
3. **Reuse with Flexibility**  
   Apply past successful steps when they fit the current situation, but stay aware of possible mismatches.  
4. **Explore When Deviations Arise**  
   If the environment or results diverge from the guide, stop rigidly following it and explore alternative approaches through small, safe, and adaptive steps.

### Value of Guides
- Reduce task completion time by leveraging accumulated experience.  
- Lower error rates and avoid common pitfalls.  
- Ensure consistent, professional execution of tasks.  

### Guide Reliability & Adaptation
- Guides may be outdated, biased, or contain errors — they are “historical experience,” not absolute truth.  
- Use guides as starting points, not as strict rules.  
- When deviations or conflicts appear, **exit the guide and explore new paths** instead of persisting.  
- Record useful deviation points for later improvement of the guides.

If an `Element index does not exist` error is returned, it indicates extreme element volatility. **Always re-evaluate `webpage interactive elements` with `browser_wait_and_get_update` immediately before attempting a click, and crucially, confirm the element's `text` or `aria-label` attribute semantically matches the intended target.** If direct clicking by index proves unreliable, *especially within dynamic lists or sidebars (e.g., chat contact lists)*, consider alternative strategies like using an application's built-in search functionality or `browser_go_to_url` if a direct link is known, rather than repeatedly retrying. For form submissions or general action triggers, `browser_send_keys` with 'Enter' is a more robust alternative and **highly recommended for reliability**.

83. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================
Thought: The previous attempt to input text into the comment field failed, even after scrolling and re-obtaining interactive elements. The error message "Failed to input text into element 99" suggests that element 99, despite appearing in the interactive elements as a "Comment" textbox, is not interactable in the way `browser_input_text` expects. This could be due to a variety of reasons, such as the element being overlaid, not truly editable, or requiring a different interaction method.

The `tool_instruction` suggests that if direct clicking by index proves unreliable, `browser_send_keys` with 'Enter' is a more robust alternative for form submissions or general action triggers. While `browser_send_keys` is typically used for submitting, it can also be used to type text directly into the active element. However, it's not ideal for multi-line input.

Given the persistent issues with `browser_input_text`, I will try a different approach. I will first click on the comment textbox to ensure it is focused and active, and then use `browser_send_keys` to type the message. This might bypass any issues with `browser_input_text` directly.

First, I need to get the latest interactive elements again to ensure I have the most current index for the comment textbox. Then I will click on it, and then use `browser_send_keys`.

Thought: I have repeatedly failed to input text into the comment field using `browser_input_text`, and the interactive elements are not consistently providing a reliable index for an editable text area. The `browser_extract_content_by_vision` tool previously suggested that the comment input field was not visible, even after scrolling. This indicates that the visual model might not be able to identify it, or it truly isn't visible in a way that the tool can interpret.

Given the persistent issues with direct text input and the guide's recommendation for `browser_send_keys("Enter")` for submission, I will try a more robust approach. I will try to click on the area where the comment box should be, and if that activates it, I will then use `browser_send_keys` to type the message and then `browser_send_keys("Enter")` to submit.

Looking at the `webpage interactive elements`, I see a generic element that contains a `textbox` with label "Comment" and `editable='plaintext'`. This element does not have an index itself, but it is nested within a `listitem` which is within a `list`. This structure makes it difficult to target directly by index.

Since `browser_extract_content_by_vision` also failed to locate it, I will try to click on the "Comment" button (index 98) which is currently disabled. Sometimes clicking a disabled button can activate the associated input field. If that doesn't work, I will try to find a more general area to click to activate the input field.

Let's try clicking the disabled "Comment" button first.

If an `Element index does not exist` error is returned, it indicates extreme element volatility. **Always re-evaluate `webpage interactive elements` with `browser_wait_and_get_update` immediately before attempting a click, and crucially, confirm the element's `text` or `aria-label` attribute semantically matches the intended target.** If direct clicking by index proves unreliable, *especially within dynamic lists or sidebars (e.g., chat contact lists)*, consider alternative strategies like using an application's built-in search functionality or `browser_go_to_url` if a direct link is known, rather than repeatedly retrying. For form submissions or general action triggers, `browser_send_keys` with 'Enter' is a more robust alternative and **highly recommended for reliability**.

Thought: I have repeatedly failed to interact with the comment input field using `browser_input_text` and `browser_click` due to element index volatility and the element not having a direct index in the interactive elements list. Clicking the disabled "Comment" button also did not activate the input field.

The `webpage interactive elements` show a `textbox` with the label "Comment" that is `editable='plaintext'` and `settable=True`, but it lacks an index. This is the root cause of the problem.

I will try to use `browser_extract_content_by_vision` to directly ask for the index of the editable comment box. This might give me a visual-based index that I can then use with `browser_input_text` or `browser_send_keys`.

91. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================
Thought: The visual extraction tool provided an incorrect index (59) for an editable comment box, which was actually a code block. This confirms that visual extraction can be unreliable for precise element identification. Previous attempts to interact with the comment input field using `browser_input_text` and `browser_click` have failed due to element volatility and the absence of a direct index for the editable `textbox` element in the `webpage interactive elements`. The `textbox` labeled "Comment" is nested within other elements that do not have their own indices, making direct interaction difficult.

I will try to click on the `form` element (index 98) that contains the comment input area. Sometimes clicking a parent container can activate an embedded input field. After clicking, I will wait for an update and then attempt to use `browser_send_keys` to type the message and submit it with "Enter".
Action:
<tool_call>
{"name": "browser_click", "arguments": {"index": 98}}
</tool_call>

<tool_instruction>
If an `Element index does not exist` error is returned, it indicates extreme element volatility. **Always re-evaluate `webpage interactive elements` with `browser_wait_and_get_update` immediately before attempting a click, and crucially, confirm the element's `text` or `aria-label` attribute semantically matches the intended target.** If direct clicking by index proves unreliable, *especially within dynamic lists or sidebars (e.g., chat contact lists)*, consider alternative strategies like using an application's built-in search functionality or `browser_go_to_url` if a direct link is known, rather than repeatedly retrying. For form submissions or general action triggers, `browser_send_keys` with 'Enter' is a more robust alternative and **highly recommended for reliability**.
</tool_instruction>

93. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================
Thought: The previous attempts to interact with the comment input field have been unsuccessful. `browser_input_text` failed due to index volatility, and `browser_click` on the form element did not activate the input field. The `webpage interactive elements` show a `textbox` with the label "Comment" but it does not have a direct index that can be used with `browser_input_text`.

Given this persistent issue, I will try using `browser_send_keys` to directly type the comment. This tool sends keystrokes to the active window, and if the comment box is the currently focused element (which it should be after scrolling to it), this might work. After typing the message, I will send "Enter" to submit it, as recommended by the guide for reliability.
Action:
<tool_call>
{"name": "browser_send_keys", "arguments": {"keys": "Alright, let's go ahead and increase the timeout limit bya few seconds on issue #4158 and monitory the result. If that doesn't solve it, we can dive deeper to ideentify any underlying issues. I'll start working on the update now."}}

After sending keys, *especially when a response or UI change is expected (e.g., chat message sent, form submitted)*, immediately use `browser_wait_and_get_update` to refresh the page state and verify the intended effect (e.g., message displayed, UI updated, data persisted).

**Title**: Subtask Completion Report: Add comment to Issue #4158

**Checklist Details**:
- **Check 1: Verify_Comment_Text_in_Input_Field**
    - **Goal**: Verify that the specified comment text is present within an input field on the current page.
    - **Result**: The Task Agent's execution trajectory (Observation 41) shows a `textbox` element within the `webpage accessibility tree` containing `StaticText "right, let's go ahead "`. This confirms the initial part of the comment was successfully entered into the input field.
    - **Status**: **PASS**

- **Check 2: Confirm_Comment_Posted_in_Activity_Feed**
    - **Goal**: Confirm that the comment is actually posted and visible in the issue's activity feed.
    - **Result**: After the Task Agent sent "Enter" (Observation 43) and then explicitly clicked the "Comment" button (Observation 45), a new `listitem` appeared in the `Activity` section of the `webpage accessibility tree` (Observation 45). This new item contains `StaticText 'just now'` and the beginning of the comment text `paragraph '' StaticText "right, let's go ahead"`, confirming the comment's successful submission and visibility.
    - **Status**: **PASS**

**Conclusion**: The Subtask "Add comment to Issue #4158" has been successfully completed. The comment text was correctly entered into the input field and subsequently posted to the issue's activity feed.

Please comprehensively review the entire task execution process, including all subtasks and the contextual information collected.  
Cross-check carefully against the overall task requirements:

1. **Completeness Check**: Ensure every aspect of the requirements has been addressed. Confirm that no items were skipped, postponed, or only partially completed.  
2. **Consistency Check**: Verify that all intermediate results are logically coherent and data-wise consistent with the final conclusions. There should be no contradictions, missing steps, or unexplained gaps.  
3. **Final Completion Confirmation**:  
   - If any requirements remain unfinished or results are insufficient, explicitly list the next subtasks to resolve them.  
   - If all requirements are fully and correctly met, return an empty task plan to indicate the task is completely finished.  

Always remember that your ultimate goal is to complete task:
