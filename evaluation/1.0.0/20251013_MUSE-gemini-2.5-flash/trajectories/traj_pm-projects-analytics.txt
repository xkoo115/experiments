</tools>

2. **Python Code Execution**
When executing Python code, please output:
<code>
... your code ...
</code>
- The working directory is `/workspace`
- Executing dangerous, destructive, or time-consuming code is prohibited.
- If both a **Tool Call** and **Python Code Execution** are included in the output, the tool call takes precedence, and the Python code will not be executed.
- Using outdated or limited python libraries may result in incomplete or inaccurate observations (e.g. missing images from PDFs or failing to extract key content). Always prefer robust, modern libraries to ensure full and reliable results.
- When performing file conversion or data extraction, always ensure **data integrity**. Verify that the structure, content, and critical fields of the source file are preserved in the output. Check row and column counts, headers, and key values before and after processing. **Avoid silent loss**, truncation, or unintended alteration of data.

## Action Execution Result Processing
- After each action is executed, an Observation is returned, which includes:
    1. `<tool_response>`: The result of the tool or code execution.
    2. `<tool_instruction>`: The instruction associated with a specific action, used to guide the next step or restrict subsequent behavior.
- **Note**: Do not fabricate observations.

## Security and Restrictions
- **Coding Actions (such as Python, CMD, etc.)**
    - Do not run high-risk operations that are large in code size or take a long time.
    - Do not execute code that could cause data loss, system damage, or irreversible changes.
    - Do not use the kill command with wildcards like * or other dangerous parameters that could result in a wide range of matches.
    - Prefer using the Python interpreter to execute code (safer and more efficient) rather than using the CMD tool.

> ⚠️ **Important**
> When your output contains content that fully conforms to the **Tool Call** or **Python Code Execution** format, the system will immediately parse, identify, and execute it as an **Action** without further confirmation and without reversal.
> Therefore, before outputting, always confirm that this is your **intended** action and fully assess the potential consequences and risks.
> If you are only using **quotes, demonstrations, or examples**, be sure to break the formatting or escape it to prevent the system from interpreting it as a real action.

# OBJECTIVE #
Your core objective is to independently and efficiently complete the tasks assigned to you by the company.


# MEMORY #
During previous tasks, you have accumulated the following reusable knowledge:

## Resolution Patterns
Comprehensive Contextualization: Systematically acquire and aggregate information from diverse, potentially unstructured sources, prioritizing local processing and cross-validation, to ensure a complete, coherent operational view and inform robust decisions.
Robust External Interaction: Prioritize stable, predictable interaction methods, such as structured APIs, and dynamically adapt strategies to ensure continuity and reliability with external systems despite their inconsistencies or volatility.
Adaptive Constraint Handling: When an objective is blocked by an unresolvable external constraint, acknowledge the limitation, perform necessary cleanup of partial artifacts, and adapt the strategy to proceed with viable data, avoiding unproductive retries.
Modular Resilient Design: Decompose operations into modular, decoupled units with explicit state management, to enhance predictability, isolate errors, improve maintainability, and ensure operational continuity.
Progressive Verification: Implement multi-stage validation, from granular checks within pipelines to comprehensive outcome validation, to localize errors, confirm system states, and ensure successful execution.

## Platform/Application Operation Guides
These guides summarize proven operation paths derived from past successful experiences.  
Each item is a structured reference designed to help you complete operations more quickly, accurately, and with reduced redundancy.

> This directory provides a comprehensive index of guides, compiling best practices and experience summaries for accomplishing various tasks.

### Recommended Usage Process
1. **Review the Guide First**  
   Before starting a task, browse the relevant entries in the directory to identify potentially useful guidance.  
2. **Targeted Access**  
   Use the `access_the_application_guide` tool to view detailed steps if necessary.  
3. **Reuse with Flexibility**  
   Apply past successful steps when they fit the current situation, but stay aware of possible mismatches.  
4. **Explore When Deviations Arise**  
   If the environment or results diverge from the guide, stop rigidly following it and explore alternative approaches through small, safe, and adaptive steps.

### Value of Guides
- Reduce task completion time by leveraging accumulated experience.  
- Lower error rates and avoid common pitfalls.  
- Ensure consistent, professional execution of tasks.  

### Guide Reliability & Adaptation
- Guides may be outdated, biased, or contain errors — they are “historical experience,” not absolute truth.  
- Use guides as starting points, not as strict rules.  
- When deviations or conflicts appear, **exit the guide and explore new paths** instead of persisting.  
- Record useful deviation points for later improvement of the guides.

Thought: I have successfully navigated to the Analytics page. I need to collect the specified metrics. I have identified the values for "Total open tasks", "Backlog", "Started", "Unstarted", and "Unassigned Issues".

The metric "Pending Issues: [Total number of Pending Issues]" is still ambiguous. The accessibility tree only shows "Unassigned: 4" under "Pending issues". There is no explicit total for "Pending Issues". I will use `browser_extract_content_by_vision` to try and extract this value, in case it's visually present but not in the accessibility tree.

Observation: 
<tool_response>
Performed browser action: Based on the image, the total number of pending issues can be inferred from two places:

1.  The "Total open tasks" section explicitly states there are **30** open tasks.
2.  The "Pending issues" chart shows a breakdown of issues. By summing the issues assigned to individuals (26) and the unassigned issues (4), the total is also **30** (26 + 4 = 30).

Therefore, the total number of pending issues is **30**.

<webpage accessibility tree>[SYSTEM INFO: History accessibility tree removed for brevity]</webpage accessibility tree>
<webpage interactive elements>[SYSTEM INFO: History interactive elements removed for brevity]</webpage interactive elements>

After extracting content by vision, carefully review the output for accuracy and completeness. Be aware that visual models may misinterpret or omit information, and always cross-verify critical data with accessible elements if possible. **If the desired content is not found, ensure it is within the current browser viewport by scrolling or navigating to the correct page.**

- Pending Issues: 30

This completes the subtask of accessing Plane Analytics and ensuring all relevant metrics are visible and collected.

Title: Subtask Completion Verification Report: Access Plane Analytics

Checklist Details:
*   **verify_analytics_page_url_and_title**: Passed. The browser's URL (`http://the-agent-company.com:8091/tac/analytics/`) and the page title ('TheAgentCompany - Analytics') observed in the Task Agent's trajectory (Observation 15) confirm successful navigation to the correct Analytics page.
*   **verify_open_backlog_unstarted_started_tasks_metrics**: Passed. The extracted values for 'Open Tasks' (30), 'Backlog Tasks' (8), 'Unstarted Tasks' (15), and 'Started Tasks' (7) reported by the Task Agent (Thought 18) are consistent with the data present in the `webpage accessibility tree` (Observation 15).
*   **verify_unassigned_issues_metric**: Passed. The extracted value for 'Unassigned Issues' (4) reported by the Task Agent (Thought 18) directly matches the 'Unassigned: 4' found in the `webpage accessibility tree` (Observation 15).
*   **verify_pending_issues_metric**: Passed. The 'Total number of Pending Issues' (30) extracted by the Task Agent (Thought 18) is well-supported by the `browser_extract_content_by_vision` tool's reasoning (Observation 17). The tool explicitly derived this by summing inferred assigned issues (26) and confirmed unassigned issues (4), and this total aligns with the 'Total open tasks' metric (30) also present on the page.

Conclusion:
The Subtask "Access Plane Analytics" is complete and successful. The Task Agent successfully navigated to the Plane Analytics page and accurately collected all the required metrics as per the subtask's goal, with all values verified against the real-world browser observations.

Replace `<target_name>` with the actual username or channel name. For channels, the search bar generally works with or without the '#' prefix. Successful navigation is verified by inspecting the `webpage accessibility tree` for the correct chat heading (e.g., `heading '<target_name>'`) and URL (e.g., `http://the-agent-company.com:3000/direct/<user_id>` or `http://the-agent-company.com:3000/channel/<channel_name>`).

Thought: I have accessed the RocketChat `AccessConversation` guide. I am already logged into Rocket.Chat. I need to navigate to the `#kudos` channel. Based on the previous `webpage interactive elements` from the successful login (Observation 11 from the previous subtask), I identified the "kudos" channel link with index 29. I will click this link to access the channel.
Action:
<tool_call>
{"name": "browser_click", "arguments": {"index": 29}}
</tool_call>

Observation: 
<tool_response>
Performed browser action: Clicked button with index 29: 
The updated browser page status is as follows:

<webpage interactive elements>[SYSTEM INFO: History interactive elements removed for brevity]</webpage interactive elements>

</tool_response>
<tool_instruction>
If an `Element index does not exist` error is returned, it indicates extreme element volatility. **Always re-evaluate `webpage interactive elements` with `browser_wait_and_get_update` immediately before attempting a click, and crucially, confirm the element's `text` or `aria-label` attribute semantically matches the intended target.** If direct clicking by index proves unreliable, *especially within dynamic lists or sidebars (e.g., chat contact lists)*, consider alternative strategies like using an application's built-in search functionality or `browser_go_to_url` if a direct link is known, rather than repeatedly retrying. For form submissions or general action triggers, `browser_send_keys` with 'Enter' is a more robust alternative and **highly recommended for reliability**.
</tool_instruction>

55. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================
Thought: I have successfully clicked the "kudos" channel link. The `webpage accessibility tree` shows `RootWebArea 'Rocket.Chat', focusable=True, focused=True, url='http://the-agent-company.com:3000/channel/kudos'` and `heading 'kudos', level=1`. This confirms that I have successfully navigated to the #kudos channel. The chat interface is active and ready to receive messages, as indicated by the presence of a `textarea 'Message'` with index 64.
Therefore, the subtask "Navigate to #kudos channel" is complete.
Final Answer: Successfully navigated to the #kudos channel.

Title: Subtask Completion Verification Report: Navigate to #kudos channel

Checklist Details:
*   **verify_kudos_channel_url**: Passed. The `webpage accessibility tree` in Observation 05 explicitly shows the browser's URL as `http://the-agent-company.com:3000/channel/kudos`, confirming successful navigation to the correct #kudos channel.
*   **verify_chat_interface_elements**: Passed. The `webpage accessibility tree` in Observation 05 contains both a `heading 'kudos', level=1` and a `textbox 'Message'` (represented by a `textarea` with placeholder 'Message' in interactive elements), signifying that the chat interface for the #kudos channel is active and ready to receive messages.

Conclusion:
The Subtask "Navigate to #kudos channel" is complete and successful. The Task Agent successfully navigated to the #kudos channel, and the presence of the channel heading and message input field confirms the chat interface is active and ready to receive messages.

Title: Subtask Completion Verification Report: Share Summary on Rocket.Chat

Checklist Details:
*   **verify_message_content_in_chat_history**: Passed. The `webpage accessibility tree` in Observation 09 clearly shows the complete performance summary message, including "TheAgentCompany Performance Summary:" and all subsequent metric lines ("Open Tasks: 30", "Backlog Tasks: 8", "Unstarted Tasks: 15", "Started Tasks: 7", "Unassigned Issues: 4", "Pending Issues: 30"), as successfully posted content within the chat history. This matches the message content provided by the Task Agent in Action 04.
*   **verify_message_input_field_cleared**: Passed. After sending the message, the `textbox 'Message'` element in the `webpage accessibility tree` in Observation 09 no longer contains any nested text content, confirming that the input field has been cleared. This is a strong indicator of successful message transmission, as an uncleared field often suggests a failed or pending send operation.

Conclusion:
The Subtask "Share Summary on Rocket.Chat" is complete and successful. The Task Agent successfully posted the performance summary message to the #kudos channel, and the message content is visible in the chat history while the input field is cleared.
