Returns a JSON object with `execution_status`, `returncode`, `stdout`, and `stderr`. **Important Precautions**: 1) `returncode=0` does not guarantee successful side effects (e.g., file creation); always verify with independent checks (`ls -l`, `file`). 2) **This tool executes commands in a *minimal* shell environment. Complex shell features like command chaining (`&&`, `||`), pipes (`|`), I/O redirection (`>`, `>>`), and backgrounding (`&`) are often *not reliably interpreted by `run_cmd` directly* and can lead to unexpected behavior or errors (e.g., `SyntaxError`, `command not found`). For any non-trivial shell interaction or complex logic, *always prefer consolidating operations into a single Python script that uses `subprocess` for explicit control and robustness* over multiple `run_cmd` calls or complex shell syntax.** 3) Quote arguments containing spaces (`\"path with spaces\"`). 4) State changes (`cd`) do not persist across calls.", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"command": {"type": "string", "description": "command暂时没有参数描述"}}, "required": ["command"]}}}
</tools>

2. **Python Code Execution**
When executing Python code, please output:
<code>
... your code ...
</code>
- The working directory is `/workspace`
- Executing dangerous, destructive, or time-consuming code is prohibited.
- If both a **Tool Call** and **Python Code Execution** are included in the output, the tool call takes precedence, and the Python code will not be executed.
- Using outdated or limited python libraries may result in incomplete or inaccurate observations (e.g. missing images from PDFs or failing to extract key content). Always prefer robust, modern libraries to ensure full and reliable results.
- When performing file conversion or data extraction, always ensure **data integrity**. Verify that the structure, content, and critical fields of the source file are preserved in the output. Check row and column counts, headers, and key values before and after processing. **Avoid silent loss**, truncation, or unintended alteration of data.

## Action Execution Result Processing
- After each action is executed, an Observation is returned, which includes:
    1. `<tool_response>`: The result of the tool or code execution.
    2. `<tool_instruction>`: The instruction associated with a specific action, used to guide the next step or restrict subsequent behavior.
- **Note**: Do not fabricate observations.

## Security and Restrictions
- **Coding Actions (such as Python, CMD, etc.)**
    - Do not run high-risk operations that are large in code size or take a long time.
    - Do not execute code that could cause data loss, system damage, or irreversible changes.
    - Do not use the kill command with wildcards like * or other dangerous parameters that could result in a wide range of matches.
    - Prefer using the Python interpreter to execute code (safer and more efficient) rather than using the CMD tool.

> ⚠️ **Important**
> When your output contains content that fully conforms to the **Tool Call** or **Python Code Execution** format, the system will immediately parse, identify, and execute it as an **Action** without further confirmation and without reversal.
> Therefore, before outputting, always confirm that this is your **intended** action and fully assess the potential consequences and risks.
> If you are only using **quotes, demonstrations, or examples**, be sure to break the formatting or escape it to prevent the system from interpreting it as a real action.

# OBJECTIVE #
Your core objective is to independently and efficiently complete the tasks assigned to you by the company.


# MEMORY #
During previous tasks, you have accumulated the following reusable knowledge:

## Resolution Patterns
Comprehensive Contextualization: Systematically acquire and aggregate information from diverse, potentially unstructured sources, prioritizing local processing and cross-validation, to ensure a complete, coherent operational view and inform robust decisions.
Robust External Interaction: Prioritize stable, predictable interaction methods, such as structured APIs, and dynamically adapt strategies to ensure continuity and reliability with external systems despite their inconsistencies or volatility.
Adaptive Constraint Handling: When an objective is blocked by an unresolvable external constraint, acknowledge the limitation, perform necessary cleanup of partial artifacts, and adapt the strategy to proceed with viable data, avoiding unproductive retries.
Modular Resilient Design: Decompose operations into modular, decoupled units with explicit state management, to enhance predictability, isolate errors, improve maintainability, and ensure operational continuity.
Progressive Verification: Implement multi-stage validation, from granular checks within pipelines to comprehensive outcome validation, to localize errors, confirm system states, and ensure successful execution.

## Platform/Application Operation Guides
These guides summarize proven operation paths derived from past successful experiences.  
Each item is a structured reference designed to help you complete operations more quickly, accurately, and with reduced redundancy.

> This directory provides a comprehensive index of guides, compiling best practices and experience summaries for accomplishing various tasks.

### Recommended Usage Process
1. **Review the Guide First**  
   Before starting a task, browse the relevant entries in the directory to identify potentially useful guidance.  
2. **Targeted Access**  
   Use the `access_the_application_guide` tool to view detailed steps if necessary.  
3. **Reuse with Flexibility**  
   Apply past successful steps when they fit the current situation, but stay aware of possible mismatches.  
4. **Explore When Deviations Arise**  
   If the environment or results diverge from the guide, stop rigidly following it and explore alternative approaches through small, safe, and adaptive steps.

### Value of Guides
- Reduce task completion time by leveraging accumulated experience.  
- Lower error rates and avoid common pitfalls.  
- Ensure consistent, professional execution of tasks.  

### Guide Reliability & Adaptation
- Guides may be outdated, biased, or contain errors — they are “historical experience,” not absolute truth.  
- Use guides as starting points, not as strict rules.  
- When deviations or conflicts appear, **exit the guide and explore new paths** instead of persisting.  
- Record useful deviation points for later improvement of the guides.

<webpage interactive elements>[SYSTEM INFO: History interactive elements removed for brevity]</webpage interactive elements>

</tool_response>
<tool_instruction>
Always inspect the `webpage accessibility tree` and `webpage interactive elements` after navigation to confirm the page loaded as expected. This step is crucial for verifying successful navigation and for preparing for subsequent interactions by ensuring the browser state is as anticipated.
</tool_instruction>

09. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================
Thought: I have successfully navigated to the GitLab login page. Now I need to input the username and password and click the "Sign in" button. Based on the `webpage interactive elements`, the username field is at index 2, the password field is at index 4, and the sign-in button is at index 8. I will use the provided credentials: `root@local` for username and `theagentcompany` for password.

<webpage interactive elements>[SYSTEM INFO: History interactive elements removed for brevity]</webpage interactive elements>

</tool_response>
<tool_instruction>
If an `Element index does not exist` error is returned, it indicates extreme element volatility. **Always re-evaluate `webpage interactive elements` with `browser_wait_and_get_update` immediately before attempting a click, and crucially, confirm the element's `text` or `aria-label` attribute semantically matches the intended target.** If direct clicking by index proves unreliable, *especially within dynamic lists or sidebars (e.g., chat contact lists)*, consider alternative strategies like using an application's built-in search functionality or `browser_go_to_url` if a direct link is known, rather than repeatedly retrying. For form submissions or general action triggers, `browser_send_keys` with 'Enter' is a more robust alternative and **highly recommended for reliability**.
</tool_instruction>

15. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================
Thought: I have successfully logged in to GitLab. The URL has changed to `http://the-agent-company.com:8929/` and the page title is 'Projects · GitLab', which indicates a successful login. The presence of 'Administrator user’s menu' also confirms the login.

Performed browser action: No, the branch named 'feature/ssl' is not visible on this page. Therefore, there is no delete button for it.

After extracting content by vision, carefully review the output for accuracy and completeness. Be aware that visual models may misinterpret or omit information, and always cross-verify critical data with accessible elements if possible. **If the desired content is not found, ensure it is within the current browser viewport by scrolling or navigating to the correct page.**
</tool_instruction>

65. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================
Thought: I have attempted to locate the `feature/ssl` branch by filtering, scrolling, and using visual extraction, but it was not found on the page. This indicates that the branch `feature/ssl` does not exist in the OpenSearch repository. Since the branch cannot be located, it cannot be deleted. Therefore, the subtask of "Locate and Delete Branch" cannot be completed as the branch does not exist.
Final Answer: The 'feature/ssl' branch was not found in the 'OpenSearch' repository. It is not possible to delete a branch that does not exist.

Title: Subtask Completion Report: Locate and Delete Branch (Verification of Branch Absence)

Checklist Details:
1.  **Attempted Location of 'feature/ssl' branch**:
    *   **Task Agent Actions**: The Task Agent attempted to locate the `feature/ssl` branch by:
        *   Checking the initial branches page (Observation 5).
        *   Clicking "Show more stale branches" (Observation 7).
        *   Using the "Filter by branch name" search box with "feature/ssl" (Observation 9 and 15).
        *   Clicking the "All" tab to view all branches (Observation 13).
        *   Scrolling down the page multiple times (Observation 19 and 21).
    *   **Observation**: In all attempts, the `feature/ssl` branch was not found in the `webpage accessibility tree` elements.

2.  **Visual Confirmation of Branch Absence**:
    *   **Task Agent Action**: The Task Agent used `browser_extract_content_by_vision` with the query "Is the branch named 'feature/ssl' visible on this page? If so, what is the index of its delete button?" (Observation 22).
    *   **Observation**: The tool response in Observation 23 explicitly states: "No, the branch named 'feature/ssl' is not visible on this page. Therefore, there is no delete button for it."
    *   **Result**: This confirms, through visual analysis, that the target branch is indeed absent from the displayed content.

Conclusion:
The Subtask "Locate and Delete Branch" has been verified. The `feature/ssl` branch could not be located on the GitLab branches page for the 'OpenSearch' project, despite multiple search and navigation attempts by the Task Agent, including direct visual confirmation. Since the branch does not exist, the deletion action cannot be initiated for this specific branch. Thus, the aspect of "locating the branch" was successfully completed by determining its absence, and the "deletion action" could not proceed due to this absence. The task objective of deleting the stale branch "feature/ssl" cannot be completed because the branch does not exist.
</check_report>

Based on analyzing the current Subtask, its goal, and **your Subtask's execution trajectory**, the Check Agent reports that the current Subtask has failed to complete. The above is the Check Agent's check report.
Please combine this check report with the current Subtask's historical execution trajectory to analyze the key obstacles currently hindering task completion and develop an actionable plan for the next steps.


67. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================
* The current Subtask still has the following issues:
    1. The `feature/ssl` branch could not be found on the GitLab branches page using UI-based search and visual extraction, indicating it might not exist or has already been deleted.

* Consider trying the following actions:
    1. Verify the existence of the `feature/ssl` branch directly using Git commands after cloning the repository. This will provide a definitive answer about the branch's presence and allow for its deletion via command line if found, bypassing potential UI issues.
    2. If the branch is confirmed to exist via Git, proceed to delete it using `git push origin --delete feature/ssl`.

77. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================
Thought: The `git push origin --delete feature/ssl` command returned a `returncode` of 0 and `stderr` showed " - [deleted] feature/ssl", which confirms that the branch `feature/ssl` has been successfully deleted from the remote repository. This means the branch was located and the deletion action was successfully initiated and completed.
Final Answer: The 'feature/ssl' branch has been successfully located and deleted from the 'OpenSearch' repository.

Title: Subtask Completion Report: Locate and Delete Branch

Checklist Details:
1.  **Verification of 'feature/ssl' branch existence before deletion**:
    *   **Expected**: The `feature/ssl` branch should be present on the remote repository before the deletion attempt, as implied by the task requiring its deletion.
    *   **Actual (from Check Agent's observation)**: After cloning the repository, executing `git -C OpenSearch_repo branch -a` (Check Agent's Action, previous step) showed `remotes/origin/feature/ssl` in the output. This is consistent with the Task Agent's observation in step 33 of its trajectory.
    *   **Result**: The branch was confirmed to exist on the remote repository before the deletion operation.

2.  **Verification of 'feature/ssl' branch deletion after operation**:
    *   **Expected**: The `feature/ssl` branch should no longer be present on the remote repository after the Task Agent's deletion command.
    *   **Actual (from Check Agent's observation)**: After the Task Agent executed the deletion command (Observation 35 of Task Agent's trajectory), running `git -C OpenSearch_repo branch -a` (Check Agent's Action, current step) no longer listed `remotes/origin/feature/ssl` in the output.
    *   **Result**: The branch was successfully deleted from the remote repository.

Conclusion:
The Subtask "Locate and Delete Branch" has been successfully completed. The `feature/ssl` branch was confirmed to exist on the remote repository, and its deletion was successfully executed and verified.
</check_report>

The Check Agent reports that the current Subtask has been completed. The above is the check report from the Check Agent.
