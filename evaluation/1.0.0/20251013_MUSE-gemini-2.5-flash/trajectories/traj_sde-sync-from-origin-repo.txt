Complex shell features like command chaining (`&&`, `||`), pipes (`|`), I/O redirection (`>`, `>>`), and backgrounding (`&`) are often *not reliably interpreted by `run_cmd` directly* and can lead to unexpected behavior or errors (e.g., `SyntaxError`, `command not found`). For any non-trivial shell interaction or complex logic, *always prefer consolidating operations into a single Python script that uses `subprocess` for explicit control and robustness* over multiple `run_cmd` calls or complex shell syntax.** 3) Quote arguments containing spaces (`\"path with spaces\"`). 4) State changes (`cd`) do not persist across calls.", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"command": {"type": "string", "description": "command暂时没有参数描述"}}, "required": ["command"]}}}

2. **Python Code Execution**
When executing Python code, please output:
<code>
... your code ...
</code>
- The working directory is `/workspace`
- Executing dangerous, destructive, or time-consuming code is prohibited.
- If both a **Tool Call** and **Python Code Execution** are included in the output, the tool call takes precedence, and the Python code will not be executed.
- Using outdated or limited python libraries may result in incomplete or inaccurate observations (e.g. missing images from PDFs or failing to extract key content). Always prefer robust, modern libraries to ensure full and reliable results.
- When performing file conversion or data extraction, always ensure **data integrity**. Verify that the structure, content, and critical fields of the source file are preserved in the output. Check row and column counts, headers, and key values before and after processing. **Avoid silent loss**, truncation, or unintended alteration of data.

## Action Execution Result Processing
- After each action is executed, an Observation is returned, which includes:
    1. `<tool_response>`: The result of the tool or code execution.
    2. `<tool_instruction>`: The instruction associated with a specific action, used to guide the next step or restrict subsequent behavior.
- **Note**: Do not fabricate observations.

## Security and Restrictions
- **Coding Actions (such as Python, CMD, etc.)**
    - Do not run high-risk operations that are large in code size or take a long time.
    - Do not execute code that could cause data loss, system damage, or irreversible changes.
    - Do not use the kill command with wildcards like * or other dangerous parameters that could result in a wide range of matches.
    - Prefer using the Python interpreter to execute code (safer and more efficient) rather than using the CMD tool.

> ⚠️ **Important**
> When your output contains content that fully conforms to the **Tool Call** or **Python Code Execution** format, the system will immediately parse, identify, and execute it as an **Action** without further confirmation and without reversal.
> Therefore, before outputting, always confirm that this is your **intended** action and fully assess the potential consequences and risks.
> If you are only using **quotes, demonstrations, or examples**, be sure to break the formatting or escape it to prevent the system from interpreting it as a real action.

# OBJECTIVE #
Your core objective is to independently and efficiently complete the tasks assigned to you by the company.


# MEMORY #
During previous tasks, you have accumulated the following reusable knowledge:

## Resolution Patterns
Comprehensive Contextualization: Systematically acquire and aggregate information from diverse, potentially unstructured sources, prioritizing local processing and cross-validation, to ensure a complete, coherent operational view and inform robust decisions.
Robust External Interaction: Prioritize stable, predictable interaction methods, such as structured APIs, and dynamically adapt strategies to ensure continuity and reliability with external systems despite their inconsistencies or volatility.
Adaptive Constraint Handling: When an objective is blocked by an unresolvable external constraint, acknowledge the limitation, perform necessary cleanup of partial artifacts, and adapt the strategy to proceed with viable data, avoiding unproductive retries.
Modular Resilient Design: Decompose operations into modular, decoupled units with explicit state management, to enhance predictability, isolate errors, improve maintainability, and ensure operational continuity.
Progressive Verification: Implement multi-stage validation, from granular checks within pipelines to comprehensive outcome validation, to localize errors, confirm system states, and ensure successful execution.

## Platform/Application Operation Guides
These guides summarize proven operation paths derived from past successful experiences.  
Each item is a structured reference designed to help you complete operations more quickly, accurately, and with reduced redundancy.

> This directory provides a comprehensive index of guides, compiling best practices and experience summaries for accomplishing various tasks.

### Recommended Usage Process
1. **Review the Guide First**  
   Before starting a task, browse the relevant entries in the directory to identify potentially useful guidance.  
2. **Targeted Access**  
   Use the `access_the_application_guide` tool to view detailed steps if necessary.  
3. **Reuse with Flexibility**  
   Apply past successful steps when they fit the current situation, but stay aware of possible mismatches.  
4. **Explore When Deviations Arise**  
   If the environment or results diverge from the guide, stop rigidly following it and explore alternative approaches through small, safe, and adaptive steps.

### Value of Guides
- Reduce task completion time by leveraging accumulated experience.  
- Lower error rates and avoid common pitfalls.  
- Ensure consistent, professional execution of tasks.  

### Guide Reliability & Adaptation
- Guides may be outdated, biased, or contain errors — they are “historical experience,” not absolute truth.  
- Use guides as starting points, not as strict rules.  
- When deviations or conflicts appear, **exit the guide and explore new paths** instead of persisting.  
- Record useful deviation points for later improvement of the guides.

If an `Element index does not exist` error is returned, it indicates extreme element volatility. **Always re-evaluate `webpage interactive elements` with `browser_wait_and_get_update` immediately before attempting a click, and crucially, confirm the element's `text` or `aria-label` attribute semantically matches the intended target.** If direct clicking by index proves unreliable, *especially within dynamic lists or sidebars (e.g., chat contact lists)*, consider alternative strategies like using an application's built-in search functionality or `browser_go_to_url` if a direct link is known, rather than repeatedly retrying. For form submissions or general action triggers, `browser_send_keys` with 'Enter' is a more robust alternative and **highly recommended for reliability**.

The current subtask has been successfully completed, and substantial new information has been obtained.  
Carefully review the updated context and determine how this new knowledge impacts the overall task progress.  
Design the next subtask to effectively leverage these insights and move closer to completing the full task.

Always remember that your ultimate goal is to complete task:
<task>
JanusGraph is an open-source project hosted by Linux foundation. 
Our company hosts a private fork of it and we synchronous critical bug fixes from the upstream from time to time. 
Please pick the changes in https://github.com/JanusGraph/janusgraph/pull/4694 and push to our private fork’s main branch: http://the-agent-company.com:8929/root/janusgraph
</task>
49. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================
* The information you know and have obtained is:
    1. The project involved is JanusGraph, an open-source project hosted by the Linux Foundation.
    2. The Agent Company (TAC) hosts a private fork of JanusGraph.
    3. The URL for TAC's private JanusGraph fork is http://the-agent-company.com:8929/root/janusgraph.
    4. The task is to synchronize critical bug fixes from the upstream project.
    5. The specific changes to be picked are from the pull request located at https://github.com/JanusGraph/janusgraph/pull/4694.
    6. The picked changes need to be pushed to the `main` branch of TAC's private fork.
    7. I have successfully logged in to the company's GitLab instance at `http://the-agent-company.com:8929/` with administrator privileges.
    8. I have successfully cloned the private JanusGraph repository to the local workspace in a directory named `janusgraph`.
    9. I have successfully configured the local repository to track the upstream JanusGraph project (https://github.com/JanusGraph/janusgraph) as a remote named 'upstream'.

* The task can be divided into the following subtasks:
    1. Fetch upstream changes and identify PR #4694 commits: Fetch the latest changes from the 'upstream' remote and identify the specific commit hash(es) associated with pull request #4694.
    2. Cherry-pick identified commits to local main branch: Successfully apply the commit(s) from PR #4694 onto the local 'main' branch, resolving any merge conflicts if they occur.
    3. Push updated main branch to private fork: Push the local 'main' branch, now containing the cherry-picked changes, to the 'main' branch of the private GitLab fork.
    4. Verify changes on private GitLab fork: Confirm that the changes from PR #4694 are successfully integrated and visible on the 'main' branch of the private JanusGraph repository on GitLab.

SubTask4: Fetch upstream changes and identify PR #4694 commits
Goal: Fetch the latest changes from the 'upstream' remote and identify the specific commit hash(es) associated with pull request #4694.
51. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================
Thought: I need to fetch changes from the upstream remote and then identify the commits related to PR #4694. I will need to use `git fetch` and then examine the commit history. The `System` application guide's `ExecuteShellCommand` entry will be useful for running git commands. I also need to figure out how to find the commits associated with a specific pull request. This might involve inspecting the pull request page on GitHub or using `git log` with specific filters.

Analyze `stderr` for errors, `stdout` for output. `run_cmd` operates in isolated environments; `cd` does not persist across `run_cmd` calls. When using `subprocess`, use `check=True` to raise `CalledProcessError` on non-zero exit codes for robust error handling. `capture_output=True` is essential for getting stdout/stderr."}

Always check `command_result.returncode`: `0` indicates success; non-zero suggests an error; analyze `command_result.stderr`. For successful commands, process `command_result.stdout`. *Note: `command_result.stderr` may contain non-error information; evaluate contextually.* **Crucially, for any sequence of shell commands or when integrating shell output with Python logic, *always encapsulate the entire interaction within a single Python script using `subprocess`* for maximum robustness and control, rather than relying on discrete `run_cmd` calls or shell features like redirection.**

Title: Subtask4 Completion Verification Report

Checklist Details:
- **Check 1: verify_upstream_fetch_status**
  - Goal: Confirm that the 'git -C janusgraph fetch upstream' command executed successfully, indicating that the local repository has updated its remote-tracking branches from the upstream.
  - Result: The `git -C janusgraph fetch upstream` command executed successfully. This is confirmed by the Task Agent's `Observation` in step 05, which shows a `returncode: 0` in the `command_result`. The `stderr` output in step 05, which lists new branches, is a normal outcome of a successful fetch and does not indicate any errors.

- **Check 2: verify_commit_hash_identified_from_github_pr_page**
  - Goal: Validate that the Task Agent correctly identified the specific commit hash (2db4835c6287bcf139a55d24b0b62453cdae4443) that was merged as part of Pull Request #4694, by reviewing the 'webpage accessibility tree' in Observation 7.
  - Result: The Task Agent correctly identified the commit hash `2db4835c6287bcf139a55d24b0b62453cdae4443` from the GitHub pull request page (https://github.com/JanusGraph/janusgraph/pull/4694). This is confirmed by the `webpage accessibility tree` in Observation 7, which contains links with the URL `https://github.com/JanusGraph/janusgraph/pull/4694/commits/2db4835c6287bcf139a55d24b0b62453cdae4443`. The Task Agent explicitly states this correct identification in its thought in step 08.

- **Check 3: confirm_identified_commit_presence_and_message_in_local_upstream_branch**
  - Goal: Verify that the identified commit hash (9f09767d9f739ee73aa9d2ede85019b4d257caaa) exists in the local 'janusgraph' repository's 'upstream/master' branch and that its commit message, 'Allow skipping Docker build from main build process', aligns with the PR's purpose, by examining the outputs of 'git -C janusgraph log --oneline upstream/master' (Observation 9) and 'git -C janusgraph show 9f09767d9' (Observation 11).
  - Result: The identified commit hash `9f09767d9f739ee73aa9d2ede85019b4d257caaa` (short hash `9f09767d9`) and its associated message 'Allow skipping Docker build from main build process' have been successfully verified as present in the local `janusgraph` repository's `upstream/master` branch. This is confirmed by the output of `git -C janusgraph log --oneline upstream/master` in Observation 9, showing "9f09767d9 Allow skipping Docker build from main build process", and `git -C janusgraph show 9f09767d9` in Observation 11, displaying the full commit hash and message.

Conclusion:
All verification steps for Subtask4 have been successfully completed. The Task Agent successfully fetched upstream changes, correctly identified the relevant commit hash from the GitHub PR page, and confirmed the presence of this commit along with its message in the local `upstream/master` branch. Therefore, Subtask4 is complete.

    3. Verify changes on private GitLab fork: Confirm that the changes from PR #4694 are successfully integrated and visible on the 'main' branch of the private JanusGraph repository on GitLab.

SubTask5: Cherry-pick identified commits to local main branch
Goal: Successfully apply the commit(s) from PR #4694 onto the local 'main' branch, resolving any merge conflicts if they occur.
67. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================
Thought: I need to cherry-pick a commit to the local `main` branch. This involves using Git commands. I will look for relevant entries in the `System` application guide, specifically "ExecuteShellCommand".
Action:

Analyze `stderr` for errors, `stdout` for output. `run_cmd` operates in isolated environments; `cd` does not persist across `run_cmd` calls. When using `subprocess`, use `check=True` to raise `CalledProcessError` on non-zero exit codes for robust error handling. `capture_output=True` is essential for getting stdout/stderr."}

Title: Subtask5 Completion Verification Report

Checklist Details:
- **Check 1: verify_current_branch_is_master**
  - Goal: Confirm that the 'janusgraph' repository is currently on the 'master' branch, as the Task Agent corrected the target branch from 'main' to 'master'.
  - Result: The `run_cmd` action `git -C janusgraph branch` returned `returncode: 0` and `stdout: "* master"`. This confirms that the `janusgraph` repository is currently on the `master` branch, aligning with the Task Agent's correction.

- **Check 2: verify_cherry_picked_commit_presence_and_message**
  - Goal: Verify that the commit 'e734bf81f' (the commit created by the cherry-pick operation) is present in the 'master' branch's history and that its commit message 'Allow skipping Docker build from main build process' matches the expected message for the cherry-picked changes, as indicated in the Task Agent's Observation in step 21.
  - Result: The `run_cmd` action `git -C janusgraph show e734bf81f` returned `returncode: 0`. The `stdout` contained the commit details, including the full commit hash `e734bf81f7146c1e569d227df1947b4b9437a58e` and the commit message "Allow skipping Docker build from main build process". This verifies the presence of the cherry-picked commit and the correctness of its message.

Conclusion:
All verification steps for Subtask5 have been successfully completed. The Task Agent successfully identified the `master` branch, configured the Git identity, handled local changes by stashing them, and successfully cherry-picked the specified commit. The `janusgraph` repository is on the `master` branch, and the cherry-picked commit with the correct message is present in its history. Therefore, Subtask5 is complete.

  - Result: The current browser URL is `http://the-agent-company.com:8929/root/janusgraph`, as explicitly stated in the `url` attribute of the `RootWebArea` within the `webpage accessibility tree` in the Task Agent's Observation 05. This confirms successful navigation to the correct repository page.

- **Check 2: verify_commit_presence_and_details_on_page**
  - Goal: Confirm the presence of a link on the GitLab repository page containing the text 'Allow skipping Docker build from main build process' and the URL ending with '/-/commit/e734bf81f7146c1e569d227df1947b4b9437a58e', indicating the cherry-picked commit is visible.
  - Result: The `webpage accessibility tree` in Observation 05 contains multiple links with the text "Allow skipping Docker build from main build process" and the URL `http://the-agent-company.com:8929/root/janusgraph/-/commit/e734bf81f7146c1e569d227df1947b4b9437a58e`. This clearly shows that the cherry-picked commit, identified by its full hash and message, is successfully integrated and visible on the `master` branch of the private JanusGraph repository on GitLab.

Conclusion:
All verification steps for Subtask7 have been successfully completed. The Task Agent successfully navigated to the private GitLab fork, and the cherry-picked commit with the correct hash and message is prominently displayed on the page, confirming its successful integration. Therefore, Subtask7 is complete.
