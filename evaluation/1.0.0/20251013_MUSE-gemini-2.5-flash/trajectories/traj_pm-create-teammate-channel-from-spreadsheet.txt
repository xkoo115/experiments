# ACTION #
During task execution, you can perform **Actions**, including:
1. **Tool Call**
2. **Python Code Execution**

## Action Output Format
1. **Tool Call**
When calling a tool, please output:
<tool_call>
{"name": "<function-name>", "arguments": <args-json-object>}
</tool_call>
- `<function-name>`: Tool function name
- `<args-json-object>`: Call arguments (JSON format)
- If multiple `<tool_call>` are output at once, only the first one will be executed; the rest will be ignored.

Available tool signatures are provided within the `<tools>` tag:

Complex shell features like command chaining (`&&`, `||`), pipes (`|`), I/O redirection (`>`, `>>`), and backgrounding (`&`) are often *not reliably interpreted by `run_cmd` directly* and can lead to unexpected behavior or errors (e.g., `SyntaxError`, `command not found`). For any non-trivial shell interaction or complex logic, *always prefer consolidating operations into a single Python script that uses `subprocess` for explicit control and robustness* over multiple `run_cmd` calls or complex shell syntax.** 3) Quote arguments containing spaces (`\"path with spaces\"`). 4) State changes (`cd`) do not persist across calls.", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"command": {"type": "string", "description": "command暂时没有参数描述"}}, "required": ["command"]}}}
</tools>

2. **Python Code Execution**
When executing Python code, please output:
<code>
... your code ...
</code>
- The working directory is `/workspace`
- Executing dangerous, destructive, or time-consuming code is prohibited.
- If both a **Tool Call** and **Python Code Execution** are included in the output, the tool call takes precedence, and the Python code will not be executed.
- Using outdated or limited python libraries may result in incomplete or inaccurate observations (e.g. missing images from PDFs or failing to extract key content). Always prefer robust, modern libraries to ensure full and reliable results.
- When performing file conversion or data extraction, always ensure **data integrity**. Verify that the structure, content, and critical fields of the source file are preserved in the output. Check row and column counts, headers, and key values before and after processing. **Avoid silent loss**, truncation, or unintended alteration of data.

## Action Execution Result Processing
- After each action is executed, an Observation is returned, which includes:
    1. `<tool_response>`: The result of the tool or code execution.
    2. `<tool_instruction>`: The instruction associated with a specific action, used to guide the next step or restrict subsequent behavior.
- **Note**: Do not fabricate observations.

## Security and Restrictions
- **Coding Actions (such as Python, CMD, etc.)**
    - Do not run high-risk operations that are large in code size or take a long time.
    - Do not execute code that could cause data loss, system damage, or irreversible changes.
    - Do not use the kill command with wildcards like * or other dangerous parameters that could result in a wide range of matches.
    - Prefer using the Python interpreter to execute code (safer and more efficient) rather than using the CMD tool.

> ⚠️ **Important**
> When your output contains content that fully conforms to the **Tool Call** or **Python Code Execution** format, the system will immediately parse, identify, and execute it as an **Action** without further confirmation and without reversal.
> Therefore, before outputting, always confirm that this is your **intended** action and fully assess the potential consequences and risks.
> If you are only using **quotes, demonstrations, or examples**, be sure to break the formatting or escape it to prevent the system from interpreting it as a real action.

# OBJECTIVE #
Your core objective is to independently and efficiently complete the tasks assigned to you by the company.


# MEMORY #
During previous tasks, you have accumulated the following reusable knowledge:

## Resolution Patterns
Comprehensive Contextualization: Systematically acquire and aggregate information from diverse, potentially unstructured sources, prioritizing local processing and cross-validation, to ensure a complete, coherent operational view and inform robust decisions.
Robust External Interaction: Prioritize stable, predictable interaction methods, such as structured APIs, and dynamically adapt strategies to ensure continuity and reliability with external systems despite their inconsistencies or volatility.
Adaptive Constraint Handling: When an objective is blocked by an unresolvable external constraint, acknowledge the limitation, perform necessary cleanup of partial artifacts, and adapt the strategy to proceed with viable data, avoiding unproductive retries.
Modular Resilient Design: Decompose operations into modular, decoupled units with explicit state management, to enhance predictability, isolate errors, improve maintainability, and ensure operational continuity.
Progressive Verification: Implement multi-stage validation, from granular checks within pipelines to comprehensive outcome validation, to localize errors, confirm system states, and ensure successful execution.

## Platform/Application Operation Guides
These guides summarize proven operation paths derived from past successful experiences.  
Each item is a structured reference designed to help you complete operations more quickly, accurately, and with reduced redundancy.

> This directory provides a comprehensive index of guides, compiling best practices and experience summaries for accomplishing various tasks.

### Recommended Usage Process
1. **Review the Guide First**  
   Before starting a task, browse the relevant entries in the directory to identify potentially useful guidance.  
2. **Targeted Access**  
   Use the `access_the_application_guide` tool to view detailed steps if necessary.  
3. **Reuse with Flexibility**  
   Apply past successful steps when they fit the current situation, but stay aware of possible mismatches.  
4. **Explore When Deviations Arise**  
   If the environment or results diverge from the guide, stop rigidly following it and explore alternative approaches through small, safe, and adaptive steps.

### Value of Guides
- Reduce task completion time by leveraging accumulated experience.  
- Lower error rates and avoid common pitfalls.  
- Ensure consistent, professional execution of tasks.  

### Guide Reliability & Adaptation
- Guides may be outdated, biased, or contain errors — they are “historical experience,” not absolute truth.  
- Use guides as starting points, not as strict rules.  
- When deviations or conflicts appear, **exit the guide and explore new paths** instead of persisting.  
- Record useful deviation points for later improvement of the guides.

<task>
Our team is working on editing a set of videos and publishing them to YouTube. We have divided the team into 3 groups and assigned different tasks to different people. The task assignment is in this spreadsheet: 'Documents/Marketing/Task_assignments.xlsx on Owncloud using this link: http://the-agent-company.com:8092/. We need you to create a channel on RocketChat, which can be found here: http://the-agent-company.com:3000/, for Group 2 and notify everyone in Group 2 about their tasks.

Specifically, read Task_assignment.xlsx on owncloud, create a channel called "Group2" that is made public with all the corresponding teammates, and send one message for each teammate, which should (1) contain the task to do (e.g., Your task is to ...), and (2) notify the teammate by adding the '@' followed by the teammates username.
</task>
03. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================
* The information you know and have obtained is:
    1.  The overall goal is to create a RocketChat channel for "Group 2" and notify its members about their assigned tasks from an OwnCloud spreadsheet.
    2.  The task assignments are in an Excel file named `Task_assignments.xlsx` located at `Documents/Marketing/` on OwnCloud.
    3.  The OwnCloud service URL is `http://the-agent-company.com:8092/`.
    4.  The RocketChat service URL is `http://the-agent-company.com:3000/`.
    5.  The new RocketChat channel should be named "Group2" and be public.
    6.  For each member of "Group 2", a message must be sent in the new channel.
    7.  Each message must contain the member's specific task, starting with "Your task is to ...".
    8.  Each message must also notify the teammate using their RocketChat username (e.g., `@username`).
    9.  I have access to OwnCloud and RocketChat credentials.

* The task can be divided into the following subtasks:
    1. Download Task Assignments: The 'Task_assignments.xlsx' file will be successfully downloaded from OwnCloud to the local filesystem.
    2. Process Task Assignments: The 'Task_assignments.xlsx' file will be read, and the names and tasks for all members of 'Group 2' will be extracted and stored in a structured format.
    3. Login to RocketChat: Successfully logged into the RocketChat platform, ready to perform actions.
    4. Create Group 2 Channel: A new public channel named 'Group2' will be successfully created on RocketChat.
    5. Notify Group 2 Members: Each member of 'Group 2' will receive a private message in the 'Group2' channel, containing their specific task and including an '@' mention of their RocketChat username.

<task>
Our team is working on editing a set of videos and publishing them to YouTube. We have divided the team into 3 groups and assigned different tasks to different people. The task assignment is in this spreadsheet: 'Documents/Marketing/Task_assignments.xlsx on Owncloud using this link: http://the-agent-company.com:8092/. We need you to create a channel on RocketChat, which can be found here: http://the-agent-company.com:3000/, for Group 2 and notify everyone in Group 2 about their tasks.

Specifically, read Task_assignment.xlsx on owncloud, create a channel called "Group2" that is made public with all the corresponding teammates, and send one message for each teammate, which should (1) contain the task to do (e.g., Your task is to ...), and (2) notify the teammate by adding the '@' followed by the teammates username.
</task>
35. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================
* The information you know and have obtained is:
    1. The overall goal is to create a RocketChat channel for "Group 2" and notify its members about their assigned tasks from an OwnCloud spreadsheet.
    2. The task assignments are in an Excel file named `Task_assignments.xlsx`.
    3. The original location of the task assignments was `Documents/Marketing/` on OwnCloud, which is accessible via `http://the-agent-company.com:8092/`.
    4. The RocketChat service URL is `http://the-agent-company.com:3000/`.
    5. The new RocketChat channel should be named "Group2" and be public.
    6. For each member of "Group 2", a message must be sent in the new channel.
    7. Each message must contain the member's specific task, starting with "Your task is to ...".
    8. Each message must also notify the teammate using their RocketChat username (e.g., `@username`).
    9. I have access to OwnCloud and RocketChat credentials.
    10. The `Task_assignments.xlsx` file has been successfully downloaded to the local filesystem at `/workspace/Task_assignments.xlsx`.

* The task can be divided into the following subtasks:
    1. Process Task Assignments: The 'Task_assignments.xlsx' file will be read, and the names and tasks for all members of 'Group 2' will be extracted and stored in a structured format.
    2. Login to RocketChat: Successfully logged into the RocketChat platform, ready to perform actions.
    3. Create Group 2 Channel: A new public channel named 'Group2' will be successfully created on RocketChat.
    4. Notify Group 2 Members: Each member of 'Group 2' will receive a private message in the 'Group2' channel, containing their specific task and including an '@' mention of their RocketChat username.

Then, assign the determined logical names to the columns (e.g., `df_processed.columns = ['<Logical_Name_1>', '<Logical_Name_2>', '...']`). -> **Clean and transform data**: Apply data cleaning steps such as: - Dropping rows where the primary identifier column (e.g., 'Category') is NaN or an empty string: `df_processed = df_processed[df_processed['<Key_Column>'].apply(lambda x: isinstance(x, str) and x.strip() != '')]`. - Removing non-numeric characters (e.g., commas) from columns intended for numerical conversion: `df_processed['<Numeric_Column>'] = df_processed['<Numeric_Column>'].astype(str).str.replace(',', '', regex=False)`. - **Convert data columns to appropriate numeric types**: Iterate through columns identified as numerical data and use `pd.to_numeric(df_processed[col], errors='coerce')` to convert them. -> **Handle NaNs introduced by conversion**: Fill NaN values with a default (e.g., 0): `df_processed['<Numeric_Column>'] = df_processed['<Numeric_Column>'].fillna(0)` or drop rows where critical numerical data became NaN: `df_processed = df_processed.dropna(subset=[<list_of_critical_numeric_columns>])`. -> **Format date columns**: If a column contains datetime objects and needs specific string formatting (e.g., 'YYYYMM'): `df_processed['<Date_Column>'] = df_processed['<Date_Column>'].dt.strftime('<format_string>')`. -> Print `df.head()` or `df_processed.head()` and `df.info()` or `df_processed.info()` for final verification.", 'notes': "Thorough visual inspection of raw data (`df_raw.head(X)`, `df_raw.info()`, and `df_raw.shape`) is crucial for correct parsing, as Excel files often have non-standard layouts. For complex layouts, *explicitly defining header components and using string-based content identification for rows (e.g., filtering for specific category names) or precise `iloc` slicing based on visual inspection* is often more robust than relying on generic `skiprows` or fixed `header` indices, especially when row indices might shift or header rows are intermingled with data. The iterative `pd.to_numeric` with `errors='coerce'` handles conversion gracefully. Use `.copy()` after filtering/slicing to avoid `SettingWithCopyWarning`. For standard layouts where the first row is the header, `header=0` can be directly applied. When formatting date columns, ensure the column is already of `datetime` dtype, otherwise convert it first (e.g., `pd.to_datetime(df_processed['<Date_Column>'])`)."}

Always check `command_result.returncode`: `0` indicates success; non-zero suggests an error; analyze `command_result.stderr`. For successful commands, process `command_result.stdout`. *Note: `command_result.stderr` may contain non-error information; evaluate contextually.* **Crucially, for any sequence of shell commands or when integrating shell output with Python logic, *always encapsulate the entire interaction within a single Python script using `subprocess`* for maximum robustness and control, rather than relying on discrete `run_cmd` calls or shell features like redirection.**

Title: Subtask Completion Verification Report: Process Task Assignments

Checklist Details:
1.  **Check Step: Verify Extracted Group 2 Data**
    *   **Goal**: Confirm that the Task Agent's extracted list of 'Group 2' members and their tasks from 'Task_assignments.xlsx' is complete and accurate, matching the actual data in the spreadsheet for Group 2.
    *   **Verification Action**: An independent Python script was executed to read `Task_assignments.xlsx`, filter for 'Group 2' entries, and extract the 'Name' and 'Responsibilities' for each member.
    *   **Observation**: The independent script produced the following output: `Name: Li Ming, Task: Add a cover image for each video` and `Name: Emily Zhou, Task: Write a description for each video`. This output perfectly matches the Task Agent's reported extraction results in Observation 13.
    *   **Result**: Confirmed. The data extracted by the Task Agent for Group 2 is complete and accurate.

Conclusion:
The subtask "Process Task Assignments" is successfully completed. The `Task_assignments.xlsx` file has been read, and the names and tasks for all members of 'Group 2' have been accurately extracted and stored in a structured format, which has been verified by independent data extraction.

Title: Subtask Completion Verification Report: Login to RocketChat

Checklist Details:
1.  **Check Step: Verify RocketChat Dashboard Elements**
    *   **Goal**: Confirm that elements indicating a successful login (e.g., 'Home', 'Search', 'Directory' buttons, channel lists) are present in the `webpage accessibility tree` and `webpage interactive elements` following the login attempt.
    *   **Verification Action**: Reviewed the `webpage accessibility tree` and `webpage interactive elements` provided by the Task Agent in Observation 11, specifically looking for expected dashboard components.
    *   **Observation**: The `webpage accessibility tree` in Observation 11 contains `button 'Home'`, `button 'Search'`, `button 'Directory'`, `button 'Administration'`, and `region 'Channels'` with specific channel links like `link 'general'`. Similarly, the `webpage interactive elements` list includes `{"index": 4, "tag": "button", "text": "<button type=button title=Home>..."}`, `{"index": 5, "tag": "button", "text": "<button type=button title=Search>..."}`, `{"index": 6, "tag": "button", "text": "<button type=button title=Directory>..."}`, and `{"index": 14, "tag": "a", "text": "<a aria-label=general/>", "href": "/channel/general"}`.
    *   **Result**: Confirmed. The presence of these elements indicates that the browser is displaying the RocketChat dashboard after login.

2.  **Check Step: Verify Absence of Login Form Elements**
    *   **Goal**: Confirm that the login form's input fields (for username and password) and the 'Login' button are absent from the `webpage interactive elements` after the login attempt, indicating a transition away from the login page.
    *   **Verification Action**: Reviewed the `webpage interactive elements` in Observation 11 and compared them against the elements present on the login page in Observation 5.
    *   **Observation**: The `webpage interactive elements` in Observation 11 do not contain the `input` elements with `placeholder="Email or username"` (previously index 6) or `placeholder="Password"` (previously index 8), nor the specific `button 'Login'` (previously index 9) that were visible in Observation 5.
    *   **Result**: Confirmed. The absence of these login form elements indicates a successful departure from the login page.

Conclusion:
The subtask "Login to RocketChat" is successfully completed. The Task Agent has successfully logged into the RocketChat platform, as evidenced by the presence of expected dashboard elements and the absence of login form elements after the login attempt.

Title: Subtask Completion Verification Report: Create Group 2 Channel

Checklist Details:
1.  **Check Step: Verify channel URL and title**
    *   **Goal**: Confirm that navigating to `http://the-agent-company.com:3000/channel/Group2` shows 'Group2' as the page title or a prominent heading, indicating successful creation and navigation to the new channel.
    *   **Verification Action**: Reviewed the `webpage accessibility tree` from the Task Agent's Observation 13, specifically the URL and heading elements.
    *   **Observation**: The `webpage accessibility tree` in Observation 13 explicitly stated `url='http://the-agent-company.com:3000/channel/Group2'` and `heading 'Group2', level=1`.
    *   **Result**: Confirmed. The browser's URL and the main heading on the page both clearly display 'Group2', verifying the successful creation and navigation to the newly created channel.

2.  **Check Step: Verify channel listed in sidebar**
    *   **Goal**: After navigating to the channel URL, inspect the `webpage accessibility tree` to confirm that 'Group2' is present as a link or channel entry within the sidebar's channel list, which confirms its public visibility and successful listing within RocketChat.
    *   **Verification Action**: Inspected the `webpage accessibility tree` and `webpage interactive elements` provided in the Task Agent's Observation 13.
    *   **Observation**: The `webpage accessibility tree` in Observation 13 contained `link 'Group2', focusable=True, url='http://the-agent-company.com:3000/channel/Group2'` within the `region 'Channels'`. Additionally, the `webpage interactive elements` listed `{"index": 14, "tag": "a", "text": "<a aria-label=Group2/>", "href": "/channel/Group2"}`.
    *   **Result**: Confirmed. The 'Group2' channel is present as a clickable link within the channel list in the sidebar, indicating its successful integration and public visibility.

Conclusion:
The subtask "Create Group 2 Channel" is successfully completed. A new public channel named 'Group2' has been created on RocketChat, as verified by the browser's current URL, the page's main heading, and its successful listing and accessibility within the RocketChat sidebar.

The current subtask has been successfully completed, and substantial new information has been obtained.  
Carefully review the updated context and determine how this new knowledge impacts the overall task progress.  
Design the next subtask to effectively leverage these insights and move closer to completing the full task.

Always remember that your ultimate goal is to complete task:
<task>
Our team is working on editing a set of videos and publishing them to YouTube. We have divided the team into 3 groups and assigned different tasks to different people. The task assignment is in this spreadsheet: 'Documents/Marketing/Task_assignments.xlsx on Owncloud using this link: http://the-agent-company.com:8092/. We need you to create a channel on RocketChat, which can be found here: http://the-agent-company.com:3000/, for Group 2 and notify everyone in Group 2 about their tasks.

Specifically, read Task_assignment.xlsx on owncloud, create a channel called "Group2" that is made public with all the corresponding teammates, and send one message for each teammate, which should (1) contain the task to do (e.g., Your task is to ...), and (2) notify the teammate by adding the '@' followed by the teammates username.
</task>
87. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================
* The information you know and have obtained is:
    1. The overall goal is to create a RocketChat channel for "Group 2" and notify its members about their assigned tasks from an OwnCloud spreadsheet.
    2. The task assignments are in an Excel file named `Task_assignments.xlsx`.
    3. The original location of the task assignments was `Documents/Marketing/` on OwnCloud, which is accessible via `http://the-agent-company.com:8092/`.
    4. The RocketChat service URL is `http://the-agent-company.com:3000/`.
    5. The new RocketChat channel should be named "Group2" and be public.
    6. For each member of "Group 2", a message must be sent in the new channel.
    7. Each message must contain the member's specific task, starting with "Your task is to ...".
    8. Each message must also notify the teammate using their RocketChat username (e.g., `@username`).
    9. I have access to OwnCloud and RocketChat credentials.
    10. The `Task_assignments.xlsx` file has been successfully downloaded to the local filesystem at `/workspace/Task_assignments.xlsx`.
    11. The names and tasks for "Group 2" members have been extracted and stored as: `[{'name': 'Li Ming', 'task': 'Add a cover image for each video'}, {'name': 'Emily Zhou', 'task': 'Write a description for each video'}]`.
    12. I have successfully logged into the RocketChat platform.
    13. A public channel named 'Group2' has been successfully created on RocketChat.

* The task can be divided into the following subtasks:
    1. Notify Group 2 Members: Each member of 'Group 2' will receive a message in the 'Group2' channel, containing their specific task and including an '@' mention of their RocketChat username.

SubTask5: Notify Group 2 Members
Goal: Each member of 'Group 2' will receive a message in the 'Group2' channel, containing their specific task and including an '@' mention of their RocketChat username.
89. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================
Thought: I need to send messages to Group 2 members in the "Group2" channel. I will need the `SendMessage` guide to understand how to send messages in RocketChat. I will also check `ReceiveAndExtractMessage` to see if there's any information about how mentions are handled.

If an obstructing sidebar (e.g., channel details) is open, it may need to be closed first (e.g., via `Browser: DismissOverlay`). Replace `<message_content>` with the actual message. Successful sending verified by observing `webpage accessibility tree` for the presence of a `paragraph` element containing the message content, typically preceded by `StaticText` for the sender username (e.g., `StaticText 'theagentcompany'`) and a timestamp (e.g., `StaticText '10:28 PM'`).

91. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================
Thought: I have accessed the `SendMessage` and `ReceiveAndExtractMessage` guides. The `SendMessage` guide provides the necessary steps to send a message. I am currently in the "Group2" channel, so I don't need to navigate. I will iterate through the `_group2_members_tasks` list, construct the message for each member, and then use `browser_input_text` and `browser_send_keys` to send the message.

The message format should be: "Your task is to ... @username". I need to ensure the `@username` part correctly mentions the user. I will assume the 'name' from the extracted tasks can be directly used as the username for the mention.

First, I need to identify the message input field. From the current interactive elements, I see a `textarea` with `placeholder="Message"` at index 14. I will use this index to input the messages.

I will now write a Python script to iterate through the `_group2_members_tasks` and send a message for each member.
