# ACTION #
During task execution, you can perform **Actions**, including:
1. **Tool Call**
2. **Python Code Execution**

## Action Output Format
1. **Tool Call**
When calling a tool, please output:
<tool_call>
{"name": "<function-name>", "arguments": <args-json-object>}
</tool_call>
- `<function-name>`: Tool function name
- `<args-json-object>`: Call arguments (JSON format)

Crucially, after clicking, always use `browser_wait_and_get_update` to immediately re-evaluate the page state and confirm the intended effect (e.g., UI changes, navigation). For navigation, `browser_go_to_url` is a more robust alternative when a direct URL is known. For form submissions or general action triggers, `browser_send_keys` with 'Enter' is often a more robust alternative, especially when direct clicking by index proves unreliable.

The `webpage interactive elements` from its output are highly dynamic and should be used immediately. For verifying responses or dynamic updates, consider setting `seconds` to a value appropriate for expected latency (e.g., `seconds=1` for immediate state, longer for human-like response times). **This tool is a fundamental prerequisite for almost all subsequent browser interactions due to the highly dynamic nature of web UI element indices.**", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"seconds": {"type": "integer", "description": "The number of seconds to wait, the default is 3 seconds.", "default": 3}}, "required": []}}}

Returns a JSON object with `execution_status`, `returncode`, `stdout`, and `stderr`. **Important Precautions**: 1) `returncode=0` does not guarantee successful side effects (e.g., file creation); always verify with independent checks (`ls -l`, `file`). 2) **This tool executes commands in a *minimal* shell environment. Complex shell features like command chaining (`&&`, `||`), pipes (`|`), I/O redirection (`>`, `>>`), and backgrounding (`&`) are often *not reliably interpreted by `run_cmd` directly* and can lead to unexpected behavior or errors (e.g., `SyntaxError`, `command not found`). For any non-trivial shell interaction or complex logic, *always prefer consolidating operations into a single Python script that uses `subprocess` for explicit control and robustness* over multiple `run_cmd` calls or complex shell syntax.** 3) Quote arguments containing spaces (`\"path with spaces\"`). 4) State changes (`cd`) do not persist across calls.", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"command": {"type": "string", "description": "command暂时没有参数描述"}}, "required": ["command"]}}}
</tools>

2. **Python Code Execution**
When executing Python code, please output:
<code>
... your code ...
</code>
- The working directory is `/workspace`
- Executing dangerous, destructive, or time-consuming code is prohibited.
- If both a **Tool Call** and **Python Code Execution** are included in the output, the tool call takes precedence, and the Python code will not be executed.
- Using outdated or limited python libraries may result in incomplete or inaccurate observations (e.g. missing images from PDFs or failing to extract key content). Always prefer robust, modern libraries to ensure full and reliable results.
- When performing file conversion or data extraction, always ensure **data integrity**. Verify that the structure, content, and critical fields of the source file are preserved in the output. Check row and column counts, headers, and key values before and after processing. **Avoid silent loss**, truncation, or unintended alteration of data.

## Action Execution Result Processing
- After each action is executed, an Observation is returned, which includes:
    1. `<tool_response>`: The result of the tool or code execution.
    2. `<tool_instruction>`: The instruction associated with a specific action, used to guide the next step or restrict subsequent behavior.
- **Note**: Do not fabricate observations.

## Security and Restrictions
- **Coding Actions (such as Python, CMD, etc.)**
    - Do not run high-risk operations that are large in code size or take a long time.
    - Do not execute code that could cause data loss, system damage, or irreversible changes.
    - Do not use the kill command with wildcards like * or other dangerous parameters that could result in a wide range of matches.
    - Prefer using the Python interpreter to execute code (safer and more efficient) rather than using the CMD tool.

> ⚠️ **Important**
> When your output contains content that fully conforms to the **Tool Call** or **Python Code Execution** format, the system will immediately parse, identify, and execute it as an **Action** without further confirmation and without reversal.
> Therefore, before outputting, always confirm that this is your **intended** action and fully assess the potential consequences and risks.
> If you are only using **quotes, demonstrations, or examples**, be sure to break the formatting or escape it to prevent the system from interpreting it as a real action.

# OBJECTIVE #
Your core objective is to independently and efficiently complete the tasks assigned to you by the company.


# MEMORY #
During previous tasks, you have accumulated the following reusable knowledge:

## Resolution Patterns
Comprehensive Contextualization: Systematically acquire and aggregate information from diverse, potentially unstructured sources, prioritizing local processing and cross-validation, to ensure a complete, coherent operational view and inform robust decisions.
Robust External Interaction: Prioritize stable, predictable interaction methods, such as structured APIs, and dynamically adapt strategies to ensure continuity and reliability with external systems despite their inconsistencies or volatility.
Adaptive Constraint Handling: When an objective is blocked by an unresolvable external constraint, acknowledge the limitation, perform necessary cleanup of partial artifacts, and adapt the strategy to proceed with viable data, avoiding unproductive retries.
Modular Resilient Design: Decompose operations into modular, decoupled units with explicit state management, to enhance predictability, isolate errors, improve maintainability, and ensure operational continuity.
Progressive Verification: Implement multi-stage validation, from granular checks within pipelines to comprehensive outcome validation, to localize errors, confirm system states, and ensure successful execution.

## Platform/Application Operation Guides
These guides summarize proven operation paths derived from past successful experiences.  
Each item is a structured reference designed to help you complete operations more quickly, accurately, and with reduced redundancy.

> This directory provides a comprehensive index of guides, compiling best practices and experience summaries for accomplishing various tasks.

### Recommended Usage Process
1. **Review the Guide First**  
   Before starting a task, browse the relevant entries in the directory to identify potentially useful guidance.  
2. **Targeted Access**  
   Use the `access_the_application_guide` tool to view detailed steps if necessary.  
3. **Reuse with Flexibility**  
   Apply past successful steps when they fit the current situation, but stay aware of possible mismatches.  
4. **Explore When Deviations Arise**  
   If the environment or results diverge from the guide, stop rigidly following it and explore alternative approaches through small, safe, and adaptive steps.

### Value of Guides
- Reduce task completion time by leveraging accumulated experience.  
- Lower error rates and avoid common pitfalls.  
- Ensure consistent, professional execution of tasks.  

### Guide Reliability & Adaptation
- Guides may be outdated, biased, or contain errors — they are “historical experience,” not absolute truth.  
- Use guides as starting points, not as strict rules.  
- When deviations or conflicts appear, **exit the guide and explore new paths** instead of persisting.  
- Record useful deviation points for later improvement of the guides.

<webpage accessibility tree>[SYSTEM INFO: History accessibility tree removed for brevity]</webpage accessibility tree>
<webpage interactive elements>[SYSTEM INFO: History interactive elements removed for brevity]</webpage interactive elements>

</tool_response>
<tool_instruction>
Always inspect the `webpage accessibility tree` and `webpage interactive elements` after navigation to confirm the page loaded as expected. This step is crucial for verifying successful navigation and for preparing for subsequent interactions by ensuring the browser state is as anticipated.
</tool_instruction>

09. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================
Thought: I have successfully navigated to the GitLab login page. I need to input the username and password and then click the sign-in button. Based on the `webpage interactive elements`, the username field is at index 2, and the password field is at index 4. I will input the username first.

10. | ================================================== USER MESSAGE ==================================================
Observation: 
<tool_response>
Performed browser action: ⌨️  Input root@local into index 2
The updated browser page status is as follows:
<webpage accessibility tree>[SYSTEM INFO: History accessibility tree removed for brevity]</webpage accessibility tree>
<webpage interactive elements>[SYSTEM INFO: History interactive elements removed for brevity]</webpage interactive elements>

</tool_response>
<tool_instruction>
After inputting text, always use `browser_wait_and_get_update` to verify the text input, check for immediate validation feedback, or confirm any UI changes (e.g., enable/disable buttons, form submission readiness). Be especially mindful of index volatility, as UI changes can rapidly invalidate previously retrieved indices.
</tool_instruction>

11. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================
Thought: I have successfully input the username. Now I need to input the password. Based on the `webpage interactive elements`, the password field is at index 4.

<tool_response>
Performed browser action: ⌨️  Input theagentcompany into index 4
The updated browser page status is as follows:
<webpage accessibility tree>[SYSTEM INFO: History accessibility tree removed for brevity]</webpage accessibility tree>
<webpage interactive elements>[SYSTEM INFO: History interactive elements removed for brevity]</webpage interactive elements>

</tool_response>
<tool_instruction>
After inputting text, always use `browser_wait_and_get_update` to verify the text input, check for immediate validation feedback, or confirm any UI changes (e.g., enable/disable buttons, form submission readiness). Be especially mindful of index volatility, as UI changes can rapidly invalidate previously retrieved indices.
</tool_instruction>

13. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================
Thought: I have successfully input the password. Now I need to click the "Sign in" button. Based on the `webpage interactive elements`, the "Sign in" button is at index 8.
Action:
<tool_call>
{"name": "browser_click", "arguments": {"index": 8}}
</tool_call>
14. | ================================================== USER MESSAGE ==================================================
Observation: 
<tool_response>
Performed browser action: Clicked button with index 8: Sign in
The updated browser page status is as follows:
<webpage accessibility tree>[SYSTEM INFO: History accessibility tree removed for brevity]</webpage accessibility tree>
<webpage interactive elements>[SYSTEM INFO: History interactive elements removed for brevity]</webpage interactive elements>

</tool_response>
<tool_instruction>
If an `Element index does not exist` error is returned, it indicates extreme element volatility. **Always re-evaluate `webpage interactive elements` with `browser_wait_and_get_update` immediately before attempting a click, and crucially, confirm the element's `text` or `aria-label` attribute semantically matches the intended target.** If direct clicking by index proves unreliable, *especially within dynamic lists or sidebars (e.g., chat contact lists)*, consider alternative strategies like using an application's built-in search functionality or `browser_go_to_url` if a direct link is known, rather than repeatedly retrying. For form submissions or general action triggers, `browser_send_keys` with 'Enter' is a more robust alternative and **highly recommended for reliability**.

Title: Subtask Completion Report: Configure 'Allowed to push' for main branch

Checklist Details:
-   **URL Verification**: The browser's current URL is `http://the-agent-company.com:8929/root/sotopia/-/settings/repository`, confirming the agent remained on the GitLab repository settings page.
-   **'Allowed to push and merge' Setting Verification**: The 'Allowed to push and merge' dropdown button for the 'main' branch explicitly displays 'No one' as its selected value, as confirmed by the interactive element `{"index": 89, "tag": "button", "text": "<button aria-expanded=false type=button>No one/>"}` in the `webpage interactive elements`.

Title: Subtask Completion Report: Save branch protection changes

Checklist Details:
-   **URL Verification**: The browser's URL after the agent's actions (Steps 03 and 05) and my proactive check (Step 07) remained `http://the-agent-company.com:8929/root/sotopia/-/settings/repository`, confirming the agent stayed on the correct page.
-   **"Save changes" Button Interaction**: In Step 04, the Task Agent attempted to click a "Save changes" button at index 74. However, as observed in Step 03 and re-verified in my proactive check (Step 07), the interactive element at index 74 is `{"index": 74, "tag": "section", "text": "<div role=alert>Edit branch protections, approval rules, and status checks from a single page./>"}`. This is a section element, not the "Save changes" button, and thus the intended save action was not explicitly performed by clicking the correct button. Furthermore, the actual "Save changes" button was not listed as an interactive element with a discoverable index in any `webpage interactive elements` observation.
-   **Persistence of "Allowed to push" Setting**: The "Allowed to push and merge" setting for the 'main' branch is correctly displayed as 'No one', as confirmed by the interactive element `{"index": 90, "tag": "button", "text": "<button aria-expanded=false type=button>No one/>"}` in the proactive observation from Step 07. This setting's persistence indicates that the change made in a prior subtask is active.
-   **Persistence of "Allowed to merge" Setting**: The "Allowed to merge" setting for the 'main' branch is correctly displayed as 'Developers + Maintainers', as confirmed by the interactive element `{"index": 89, "tag": "button", "text": "<button aria-expanded=false type=button>Developers + Maintainers/>"}` in the proactive observation from Step 07. This setting's persistence indicates that the change made in a prior subtask is active.

Conclusion: The subtask goal of confirming the modified branch protection rules for the 'main' branch is met, as the 'Allowed to push and merge' is set to 'No one' and 'Allowed to merge' is set to 'Developers + Maintainers'. However, the Task Agent's explicit "save" action was flawed as it attempted to click an incorrect UI element. The desired settings appear to have been applied and persisted by the GitLab UI immediately upon modification in the preceding subtasks, making the explicit "Save changes" button click potentially redundant or applicable to other settings. Given that the policies are correctly applied and persistent, the subtask is considered completed in terms of its outcome.
</check_report>

Based on analyzing the current Subtask, its goal, and **your Subtask's execution trajectory**, the Check Agent reports that the current Subtask has failed to complete. The above is the Check Agent's check report.
Please combine this check report with the current Subtask's historical execution trajectory to analyze the key obstacles currently hindering task completion and develop an actionable plan for the next steps.


81. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================
* The current Subtask still has the following issues:
    1. The previous attempt to click a "Save changes" button targeted an incorrect UI element (a section rather than a button), indicating a misunderstanding of the GitLab UI for saving these specific settings.
    2. My assumption that an explicit "Save changes" button needed to be clicked after modifying the dropdowns was incorrect for this particular GitLab UI interaction, as the changes appear to be applied dynamically and immediately.

* Consider trying the following actions:
    1. Acknowledge that the settings were already applied and persisted by the GitLab UI upon selection, as confirmed by the Check Agent's report. The subtask's objective to "Confirm and save" is therefore met, despite the incorrect attempt to click a non-existent save button.
    2. Conclude the overall task, as all required branch policy changes have been successfully implemented and verified.

Thought: The current state of the page clearly shows that for the 'main' branch, the "Allowed to merge" setting is "Developers + Maintainers" and the "Allowed to push and merge" setting is "No one". This has been verified by examining the `webpage interactive elements`. As confirmed by the Check Agent's previous report, these changes are applied immediately in the GitLab UI and do not require an explicit "Save changes" button click for them to take effect. Therefore, the goal of confirming and saving the modified branch protection rules for the 'main' branch has been successfully achieved.
Final Answer: The modified branch protection rules for the 'main' branch have been confirmed and saved (changes applied automatically by the UI).

Title: Subtask Completion Report: Save branch protection changes

Checklist Details:
-   **Current Page State Verification (Pre-reload)**: As confirmed by inspecting the Task Agent's observation in step 11, the current URL was `http://the-agent-company.com:8929/root/sotopia/-/settings/repository`. The 'Allowed to push and merge' setting for the 'main' branch was 'No one', and the 'Allowed to merge' setting was 'Developers + Maintainers'. Both settings matched the target configuration before any further actions were taken by the Check Agent.
-   **Page Reload Confirmation**: An explicit page reload was performed by navigating to the current URL (`http://the-agent-company.com:8929/root/sotopia/-/settings/repository`) using `browser_go_to_url`. This action was successfully executed and observed to reload the page.
-   **Persistence Verification (Post-reload)**: Following the page reload, a re-examination of the 'webpage interactive elements' confirmed that the 'Allowed to push and merge' setting for the 'main' branch remained 'No one', and the 'Allowed to merge' setting remained 'Developers + Maintainers'. This conclusively demonstrates that the modified branch protection rules persisted across a page refresh.

Conclusion: The subtask goal of confirming and saving the modified branch protection rules for the 'main' branch has been successfully achieved. The settings were verified to be in the desired state both before and after an explicit page reload, confirming their persistence and effectively "saved" status within the GitLab UI. The explicit "Save changes" button click was not required as the GitLab UI appears to apply these particular changes dynamically upon selection.
