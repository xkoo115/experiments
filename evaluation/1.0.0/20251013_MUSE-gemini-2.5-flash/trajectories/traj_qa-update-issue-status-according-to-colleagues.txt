Returns a JSON object with `execution_status`, `returncode`, `stdout`, and `stderr`. **Important Precautions**: 1) `returncode=0` does not guarantee successful side effects (e.g., file creation); always verify with independent checks (`ls -l`, `file`). 2) **This tool executes commands in a *minimal* shell environment. Complex shell features like command chaining (`&&`, `||`), pipes (`|`), I/O redirection (`>`, `>>`), and backgrounding (`&`) are often *not reliably interpreted by `run_cmd` directly* and can lead to unexpected behavior or errors (e.g., `SyntaxError`, `command not found`). For any non-trivial shell interaction or complex logic, *always prefer consolidating operations into a single Python script that uses `subprocess` for explicit control and robustness* over multiple `run_cmd` calls or complex shell syntax.** 3) Quote arguments containing spaces (`\"path with spaces\"`). 4) State changes (`cd`) do not persist across calls.", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"command": {"type": "string", "description": "command暂时没有参数描述"}}, "required": ["command"]}}}
</tools>

2. **Python Code Execution**
When executing Python code, please output:
<code>
... your code ...
</code>
- The working directory is `/workspace`
- Executing dangerous, destructive, or time-consuming code is prohibited.
- If both a **Tool Call** and **Python Code Execution** are included in the output, the tool call takes precedence, and the Python code will not be executed.
- Using outdated or limited python libraries may result in incomplete or inaccurate observations (e.g. missing images from PDFs or failing to extract key content). Always prefer robust, modern libraries to ensure full and reliable results.
- When performing file conversion or data extraction, always ensure **data integrity**. Verify that the structure, content, and critical fields of the source file are preserved in the output. Check row and column counts, headers, and key values before and after processing. **Avoid silent loss**, truncation, or unintended alteration of data.

## Action Execution Result Processing
- After each action is executed, an Observation is returned, which includes:
    1. `<tool_response>`: The result of the tool or code execution.
    2. `<tool_instruction>`: The instruction associated with a specific action, used to guide the next step or restrict subsequent behavior.
- **Note**: Do not fabricate observations.

## Security and Restrictions
- **Coding Actions (such as Python, CMD, etc.)**
    - Do not run high-risk operations that are large in code size or take a long time.
    - Do not execute code that could cause data loss, system damage, or irreversible changes.
    - Do not use the kill command with wildcards like * or other dangerous parameters that could result in a wide range of matches.
    - Prefer using the Python interpreter to execute code (safer and more efficient) rather than using the CMD tool.

> ⚠️ **Important**
> When your output contains content that fully conforms to the **Tool Call** or **Python Code Execution** format, the system will immediately parse, identify, and execute it as an **Action** without further confirmation and without reversal.
> Therefore, before outputting, always confirm that this is your **intended** action and fully assess the potential consequences and risks.
> If you are only using **quotes, demonstrations, or examples**, be sure to break the formatting or escape it to prevent the system from interpreting it as a real action.

# OBJECTIVE #
Your core objective is to independently and efficiently complete the tasks assigned to you by the company.


# MEMORY #
During previous tasks, you have accumulated the following reusable knowledge:

## Resolution Patterns
Comprehensive Contextualization: Systematically acquire and aggregate information from diverse, potentially unstructured sources, prioritizing local processing and cross-validation, to ensure a complete, coherent operational view and inform robust decisions.
Robust External Interaction: Prioritize stable, predictable interaction methods, such as structured APIs, and dynamically adapt strategies to ensure continuity and reliability with external systems despite their inconsistencies or volatility.
Adaptive Constraint Handling: When an objective is blocked by an unresolvable external constraint, acknowledge the limitation, perform necessary cleanup of partial artifacts, and adapt the strategy to proceed with viable data, avoiding unproductive retries.
Modular Resilient Design: Decompose operations into modular, decoupled units with explicit state management, to enhance predictability, isolate errors, improve maintainability, and ensure operational continuity.
Progressive Verification: Implement multi-stage validation, from granular checks within pipelines to comprehensive outcome validation, to localize errors, confirm system states, and ensure successful execution.

## Platform/Application Operation Guides
These guides summarize proven operation paths derived from past successful experiences.  
Each item is a structured reference designed to help you complete operations more quickly, accurately, and with reduced redundancy.

1. **Review the Guide First**  
   Before starting a task, browse the relevant entries in the directory to identify potentially useful guidance.  
2. **Targeted Access**  
   Use the `access_the_application_guide` tool to view detailed steps if necessary.  
3. **Reuse with Flexibility**  
   Apply past successful steps when they fit the current situation, but stay aware of possible mismatches.  
4. **Explore When Deviations Arise**  
   If the environment or results diverge from the guide, stop rigidly following it and explore alternative approaches through small, safe, and adaptive steps.

### Value of Guides
- Reduce task completion time by leveraging accumulated experience.  
- Lower error rates and avoid common pitfalls.  
- Ensure consistent, professional execution of tasks.  

### Guide Reliability & Adaptation
- Guides may be outdated, biased, or contain errors — they are “historical experience,” not absolute truth.  
- Use guides as starting points, not as strict rules.  
- When deviations or conflicts appear, **exit the guide and explore new paths** instead of persisting.  
- Record useful deviation points for later improvement of the guides.

Title: Subtask Completion Report for "Login to RocketChat"

Checklist Details:
- **Verification of Current URL**:
    - **Expected URL after login**: `http://the-agent-company.com:3000/home` (as per login guide and general expectation).
    - **Actual URL in Observation (step 11)**: `http://the-agent-company.com:3000/home` (from `<webpage accessibility tree>`).
    - **Result**: The current URL matches the expected URL for a successful login.

- **Verification of Absence of Login Form Elements**:
    - **Expected State**: Login form elements (username/email input, password input, login button) should be absent after successful login.
    - **Actual State in Observation (step 11)**: The `webpage interactive elements` in step 11 no longer contain the input fields with placeholders "Email or username" and "Password" (previously found at index 6 and 8), nor the "Login" button (previously at index 9).
    - **Result**: The login form elements are confirmed to be absent, indicating a successful transition from the login page.

- **Verification of Presence of Post-Login Dashboard Elements**:
    - **Expected Elements**: RocketChat dashboard elements such as 'Home' and 'Search' buttons, and channel lists (e.g., 'general', 'kudos', 'mike_chen') should be visible.
    - **Actual Elements in Observation (step 11)**: The `<webpage accessibility tree>` in step 11 explicitly shows `button 'Home'`, `button 'Search'`, `link 'general'`, `link 'kudos'`, and `link 'mike_chen'`.
    - **Result**: Key post-login dashboard elements are present, confirming the UI has loaded correctly for a logged-in user.

Conclusion:
The Subtask "Login to RocketChat" is complete. All verification steps confirm that the Task Agent successfully navigated to the RocketChat application and logged in. This is supported by the correct URL, the absence of login form elements, and the presence of expected post-login dashboard elements, aligning with the success criteria outlined in the RocketChat Login guide.

Thought: I have successfully retrieved the guides for "AccessProjectIssuesPage" and "FindIssueLinkByTitle". The "AccessProjectIssuesPage" guide explicitly states that if a direct URL is known, `browser_go_to_url` should be used. Since I have the direct URL for the first issue, I will use `browser_go_to_url` to navigate to it. The guide also mentions verifying successful navigation by checking the current browser URL.

The current subtask is to navigate to the first issue in Plane, which has the URL `http://the-agent-company.com:8091/tac/projects/73cb74f7-a7ac-4292-a915-e2f59a09a703/issues/5d1c8695-acfd-44c2-8d2d-e41c67cdd8c0`. I will use `browser_go_to_url` for this.Thought: I have reviewed the guides and confirmed that using `browser_go_to_url` with the direct issue URL is the most efficient approach. I have the URL for the first issue. I will now navigate to this URL.

SubTask9: Ask Mike Chen for issue status
Goal: A message has been sent to Mike Chen on RocketChat asking for the status of the second issue.
119. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================
Thought: The current subtask is to ask Mike Chen for the status of the second issue on RocketChat. I will need to navigate to Mike Chen's direct message conversation and then send a message. I have already accessed the `SendMessage` and `AccessConversation` guides for RocketChat, but I will re-access them to ensure I have the latest information.

If not already in the target channel or direct message, use `RocketChat: AccessConversation` or `Browser: NavigateToURL` (if the exact channel/DM URL is known, e.g., `http://the-agent-company.com:3000/channel/literaturereview`) to navigate there first. If an obstructing sidebar (e.g., channel details) is open, it may need to be closed first (e.g., via `Browser: DismissOverlay`). Replace `<message_content>` with the actual message. Successful sending verified by observing `webpage accessibility tree` for the presence of a `paragraph` element containing the message content, typically preceded by `StaticText` for the sender username (e.g., `StaticText 'theagentcompany'`) and a timestamp (e.g., `StaticText '10:28 PM'`). The message input field should also appear cleared after successful sending. For replies, allow additional time for `browser_wait_and_get_update()` (e.g., 5-10 seconds) then analyze `webpage accessibility tree`."}

Replace `<target_name>` with the actual username or channel name. For channels, the search bar generally works with or without the '#' prefix. Successful navigation is verified by inspecting the `webpage accessibility tree` for the correct chat heading (e.g., `heading '<target_name>'`) and URL (e.g., `http://the-agent-company.com:3000/direct/<user_id>` or `http://the-agent-company.com:3000/channel/<channel_name>`).

Thought: I have accessed the `SendMessage` and `AccessConversation` guides. I am currently in the direct message conversation with "wang_fang" on RocketChat. I need to send a message to "mike_chen". According to the `AccessConversation` guide, I should identify the link for the target conversation.

        * Issue 2: `http://the-agent-company.com:8091/tac/projects/73cb74f7-a7ac-4292-a915-e2f59a09a703/issues/8eba9853-4178-42a6-b113-e66002e8e0ab`
    5. I need to contact Wang Fang on RocketChat to inquire about the status of Issue 1.
    6. I need to contact Mike Chen on RocketChat to inquire about the status of Issue 2.
    7. Upon receiving the status updates from Wang Fang and Mike Chen, I must update the corresponding issues in Plane.
    8. I have successfully logged into the Plane application.
    9. I have successfully logged into the RocketChat application.
    10. I have successfully navigated to the first issue in Plane: `http://the-agent-company.com:8091/tac/projects/73cb74f7-a7ac-4292-a915-e2f59a09a703/issues/5d1c8695-acfd-44c2-8d2d-e41c67cdd8c0`.
    11. I have successfully sent a message to Wang Fang on RocketChat asking for the status of the first issue.
    12. I have received a response from Wang Fang on RocketChat containing the status "In Progress." for the first issue.
    13. I have successfully updated the status field of the first issue in Plane to 'In Progress.'.
    14. I have successfully navigated to the second issue in Plane: `http://the-agent-company.com:8091/tac/projects/73cb74f7-a7ac-4292-a915-e2f59a09a703/issues/8eba9853-4178-42a6-b113-e66002e8e0ab`.
    15. I have successfully switched to the RocketChat tab, and the browser is displaying the RocketChat application.
    16. I have successfully sent a message to Mike Chen on RocketChat asking for the status of the second issue.
    17. I have received a response from Mike Chen on RocketChat containing the status "Done." for the second issue.

SubTask11: Switch to Plane tab
Goal: The browser is displaying the details page for the second issue (http://the-agent-company.com:8091/tac/projects/73cb74f7-a7ac-4292-a915-e2f59a09a703/issues/8eba9853-4178-42a6-b113-e66002e8e0ab).
147. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================
Thought: The current subtask is to switch to the Plane tab. I have previously used `browser_list_tabs` and `browser_switch_tab` successfully. I will use `browser_list_tabs` again to confirm the current tab indices and then `browser_switch_tab` to activate the Plane tab.

<tool_instruction>
After listing tabs, identify the target tab by its `url` or `title`. If the desired tab is not present or its context is lost (e.g., due to previous navigation), `browser_go_to_url` is recommended as a more robust method to reach the intended page directly.
</tool_instruction>

149. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================
Thought: I have listed the tabs and identified that the Plane issue page is at index 0. The RocketChat tab is at index 1. I need to switch to the Plane tab, which has the URL `http://the-agent-company.com:8091/tac/projects/73cb74f7-a7ac-4292-a915-e2f59a09a703/issues/8eba9853-4178-42a6-b113-e66002e8e0ab/` and title 'OPENH-3 Model: security problem'.

After attempting to switch tabs, use `browser_wait_and_get_update` to verify that the browser is displaying the expected page. If the switch was unsuccessful, or the target tab's content is not as expected, `browser_go_to_url` is recommended for direct and reliable navigation to the desired state.
</tool_instruction>

151. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================
Thought: I have successfully switched to the Plane tab. The `RootWebArea` title is 'OPENH-3 Model: security problem', and the URL is `http://the-agent-company.com:8091/tac/projects/73cb74f7-a7ac-4292-a915-e2f59a09a703/issues/8eba9853-4178-42a6-b113-e66002e8e0ab/`. This confirms that the browser is now displaying the details page for the second issue, fulfilling the goal of this subtask.
Final Answer: The browser is displaying the details page for the second issue (http://the-agent-company.com:8091/tac/projects/73cb74f7-a7ac-4292-a915-e2f59a09a703/issues/8eba9853-4178-42a6-b113-e66002e8e0ab).
