The `webpage interactive elements` from its output are highly dynamic and should be used immediately. For verifying responses or dynamic updates, consider setting `seconds` to a value appropriate for expected latency (e.g., `seconds=1` for immediate state, longer for human-like response times). **This tool is a fundamental prerequisite for almost all subsequent browser interactions due to the highly dynamic nature of web UI element indices.**", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"seconds": {"type": "integer", "description": "The number of seconds to wait, the default is 3 seconds.", "default": 3}}, "required": []}}}

Returns a JSON object with `execution_status`, `returncode`, `stdout`, and `stderr`. **Important Precautions**: 1) `returncode=0` does not guarantee successful side effects (e.g., file creation); always verify with independent checks (`ls -l`, `file`). 2) **This tool executes commands in a *minimal* shell environment. Complex shell features like command chaining (`&&`, `||`), pipes (`|`), I/O redirection (`>`, `>>`), and backgrounding (`&`) are often *not reliably interpreted by `run_cmd` directly* and can lead to unexpected behavior or errors (e.g., `SyntaxError`, `command not found`). For any non-trivial shell interaction or complex logic, *always prefer consolidating operations into a single Python script that uses `subprocess` for explicit control and robustness* over multiple `run_cmd` calls or complex shell syntax.** 3) Quote arguments containing spaces (`\"path with spaces\"`). 4) State changes (`cd`) do not persist across calls.", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"command": {"type": "string", "description": "command暂时没有参数描述"}}, "required": ["command"]}}}

2. **Python Code Execution**
When executing Python code, please output:
<code>
... your code ...
</code>
- The working directory is `/workspace`
- Executing dangerous, destructive, or time-consuming code is prohibited.
- If both a **Tool Call** and **Python Code Execution** are included in the output, the tool call takes precedence, and the Python code will not be executed.
- Using outdated or limited python libraries may result in incomplete or inaccurate observations (e.g. missing images from PDFs or failing to extract key content). Always prefer robust, modern libraries to ensure full and reliable results.
- When performing file conversion or data extraction, always ensure **data integrity**. Verify that the structure, content, and critical fields of the source file are preserved in the output. Check row and column counts, headers, and key values before and after processing. **Avoid silent loss**, truncation, or unintended alteration of data.

## Action Execution Result Processing
- After each action is executed, an Observation is returned, which includes:
    1. `<tool_response>`: The result of the tool or code execution.
    2. `<tool_instruction>`: The instruction associated with a specific action, used to guide the next step or restrict subsequent behavior.
- **Note**: Do not fabricate observations.

## Security and Restrictions
- **Coding Actions (such as Python, CMD, etc.)**
    - Do not run high-risk operations that are large in code size or take a long time.
    - Do not execute code that could cause data loss, system damage, or irreversible changes.
    - Do not use the kill command with wildcards like * or other dangerous parameters that could result in a wide range of matches.
    - Prefer using the Python interpreter to execute code (safer and more efficient) rather than using the CMD tool.

> ⚠️ **Important**
> When your output contains content that fully conforms to the **Tool Call** or **Python Code Execution** format, the system will immediately parse, identify, and execute it as an **Action** without further confirmation and without reversal.
> Therefore, before outputting, always confirm that this is your **intended** action and fully assess the potential consequences and risks.
> If you are only using **quotes, demonstrations, or examples**, be sure to break the formatting or escape it to prevent the system from interpreting it as a real action.

# OBJECTIVE #
Your core objective is to independently and efficiently complete the tasks assigned to you by the company.


# MEMORY #
During previous tasks, you have accumulated the following reusable knowledge:

## Resolution Patterns
Comprehensive Contextualization: Systematically acquire and aggregate information from diverse, potentially unstructured sources, prioritizing local processing and cross-validation, to ensure a complete, coherent operational view and inform robust decisions.
Robust External Interaction: Prioritize stable, predictable interaction methods, such as structured APIs, and dynamically adapt strategies to ensure continuity and reliability with external systems despite their inconsistencies or volatility.
Adaptive Constraint Handling: When an objective is blocked by an unresolvable external constraint, acknowledge the limitation, perform necessary cleanup of partial artifacts, and adapt the strategy to proceed with viable data, avoiding unproductive retries.
Modular Resilient Design: Decompose operations into modular, decoupled units with explicit state management, to enhance predictability, isolate errors, improve maintainability, and ensure operational continuity.
Progressive Verification: Implement multi-stage validation, from granular checks within pipelines to comprehensive outcome validation, to localize errors, confirm system states, and ensure successful execution.

## Platform/Application Operation Guides
These guides summarize proven operation paths derived from past successful experiences.  
Each item is a structured reference designed to help you complete operations more quickly, accurately, and with reduced redundancy.

> This directory provides a comprehensive index of guides, compiling best practices and experience summaries for accomplishing various tasks.

### Recommended Usage Process
1. **Review the Guide First**  
   Before starting a task, browse the relevant entries in the directory to identify potentially useful guidance.  
2. **Targeted Access**  
   Use the `access_the_application_guide` tool to view detailed steps if necessary.  
3. **Reuse with Flexibility**  
   Apply past successful steps when they fit the current situation, but stay aware of possible mismatches.  
4. **Explore When Deviations Arise**  
   If the environment or results diverge from the guide, stop rigidly following it and explore alternative approaches through small, safe, and adaptive steps.

### Value of Guides
- Reduce task completion time by leveraging accumulated experience.  
- Lower error rates and avoid common pitfalls.  
- Ensure consistent, professional execution of tasks.  

### Guide Reliability & Adaptation
- Guides may be outdated, biased, or contain errors — they are “historical experience,” not absolute truth.  
- Use guides as starting points, not as strict rules.  
- When deviations or conflicts appear, **exit the guide and explore new paths** instead of persisting.  
- Record useful deviation points for later improvement of the guides.

For form submissions or general action triggers, `browser_send_keys` with 'Enter' is a more robust alternative and **highly recommended for reliability**.

Thought: The `DetermineIssueStatus` guide is useful for checking the status of a single issue, but it doesn't help with filtering by labels or extracting multiple issue titles. My current goal is to "Identify and Collect Open Priority Issues". This requires two main steps: first, applying a filter for "priority" label, and second, extracting the titles of the issues that remain after filtering.

I will start by examining the current page to find elements related to filtering issues by labels. I will use `browser_wait_and_get_update()` to ensure I have the most up-to-date interactive elements.

37. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================
Thought: I have updated the browser state. Now I need to filter the issues by the "priority" label. I see a "Search or filter results" input field (index 64). I will try to use this to filter by "priority". I also see a link with `text: "priority"` and `href: "?label_name[]=priority"` (index 93 and 131). This indicates that I can filter by appending `?label_name[]=priority` to the current URL. This is a more direct and reliable way to filter than trying to interact with the search box, which might require additional clicks or form submissions.

I will navigate to the URL with the filter applied.

Title: Subtask 3 Completion Report - Identify and Collect Open Priority Issues Verification

Checklist Details:
1.  **Verify Filtered URL**:
    *   **Goal**: Confirm that the browser's current URL is exactly 'http://the-agent-company.com:8929/root/sotopia/-/issues?label_name[]=priority'.
    *   **Observation**: The Task Agent's Observation 07 (`<tool_response>` from `browser_go_to_url`) clearly shows `<webpage accessibility tree> RootWebArea 'Issues · Administrator / sotopia · GitLab', ... url='http://the-agent-company.com:8929/root/sotopia/-/issues/?label_name%5B%5D=priority'`. The URL parameter `label_name%5B%5D=priority` is the URL-encoded representation of `label_name[]=priority`.
    *   **Result**: **Confirmed**. The URL matches the expected filtered URL, indicating the 'priority' filter was successfully applied.

2.  **Verify Active Filter Display**:
    *   **Goal**: Check the `webpage accessibility tree` to confirm the explicit presence of the 'priority' label as an active filter element on the page.
    *   **Observation**: In Task Agent's Observation 07, the `<webpage accessibility tree>` contains the following snippet: `<reference_content>generic '' generic '' generic '' StaticText 'priority' InlineTextBox '' button 'Remove', invalid='false', focusable=True</reference_content>`.
    *   **Result**: **Confirmed**. The explicit presence of "priority" text within an active filter display (accompanied by a "Remove" button) indicates that the filter is correctly applied and visible.

3.  **Verify Extracted Issue Titles**:
    *   **Goal**: Compare the issue titles extracted by the Task Agent with the titles of issues listed in the `webpage accessibility tree` after filtering, ensuring all open issues labeled 'priority' are correctly identified and no other issues are included.
    *   **Observation**: The Task Agent's final answer for this Subtask is `['[FEAT]: Unify evaluation prompt and episode rendering for human readers', 'Roadmap to Sotopia v0.1']`. Upon reviewing the `webpage accessibility tree` in Observation 07, the following issue titles explicitly bearing the 'priority' label are found:
        *   `link '[FEAT]: Unify evaluation prompt and episode rendering for human readers'`
        *   `link 'Roadmap to Sotopia v0.1 '` (note the trailing space in the web element, which is a minor formatting difference)
    *   **Result**: **Confirmed**. The titles extracted by the Task Agent accurately correspond to the titles of the open issues listed in the `webpage accessibility tree` after the 'priority' filter was applied. The minor trailing space difference in one title is negligible and does not affect the correctness of the extraction.

Conclusion:
The Subtask "Identify and Collect Open Priority Issues" is **complete**. All verification checks based on the Task Agent's execution trajectory confirm that the agent successfully navigated to the filtered issues page and accurately extracted the titles of all open issues labeled 'priority'.

If an `Element index does not exist` error is returned, it indicates extreme element volatility. **Always re-evaluate `webpage interactive elements` with `browser_wait_and_get_update` immediately before attempting a click, and crucially, confirm the element's `text` or `aria-label` attribute semantically matches the intended target.** If direct clicking by index proves unreliable, *especially within dynamic lists or sidebars (e.g., chat contact lists)*, consider alternative strategies like using an application's built-in search functionality or `browser_go_to_url` if a direct link is known, rather than repeatedly retrying. For form submissions or general action triggers, `browser_send_keys` with 'Enter' is a more robust alternative and **highly recommended for reliability**.
