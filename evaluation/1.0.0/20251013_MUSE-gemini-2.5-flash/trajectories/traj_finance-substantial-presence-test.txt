# ACTION #
During task execution, you can perform **Actions**, including:
1. **Tool Call**
2. **Python Code Execution**

## Action Output Format
1. **Tool Call**
When calling a tool, please output:
<tool_call>
{"name": "<function-name>", "arguments": <args-json-object>}
</tool_call>
- `<function-name>`: Tool function name
- `<args-json-object>`: Call arguments (JSON format)
- If multiple `<tool_call>` are output at once, only the first one will be executed; the rest will be ignored.

Available tool signatures are provided within the `<tools>` tag:

Highly effective for **scanned documents, image-based PDFs (post-conversion to image formats),** or visual data. For optimal extraction, craft precise queries. **Caution: While effective for general content, direct numerical or highly structured extraction from complex visual elements (e.g., tally marks, handwritten notes) may be imprecise; robust post-processing is often required. For multi-page documents, convert each page into a separate image and ensure *all* generated image pages are processed for complete data extraction.**", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"image_path": {"type": "string", "description": "Local image path."}, "query": {"type": "string", "description": "Query to the gpt-4o to get the image content."}}, "required": ["image_path", "query"]}}}

Element indices are dynamic and highly volatile; always verify the target element's existence and index using `browser_wait_and_get_update` immediately before clicking. Be aware that even with immediate updates, indices can shift in very dynamic UIs. Crucially, after clicking, always use `browser_wait_and_get_update` to immediately re-evaluate the page state and confirm the intended effect (e.g., UI changes, navigation). For navigation, `browser_go_to_url` is a more robust alternative when a direct URL is known. For form submissions or general action triggers, `browser_send_keys` with 'Enter' is often a more robust alternative, especially when direct clicking by index proves unreliable. Avoid clicking elements that are not currently visible or interactable.", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"index": {"type": "integer", "description": "The index number of the target element."}}, "required": ["index"]}}}

It cannot process content that is scrolled out of view or exists on other pages of a paginated list. While `accessibility tree` and `interactive elements` are primary for UI understanding, this visual tool can be a highly effective *primary* method for text extraction in challenging scenarios. **Crucially, for critical or structured data (e.g., IDs, specific names, numerical values), always cross-verify with or prefer extraction from the `webpage accessibility tree` as visual interpretation may introduce inaccuracies, especially for abbreviated or visually ambiguous elements.**", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"query": {"type": "string", "description": "Query to the VL model to get the browser page content."}}, "required": ["query"]}}}

</tools>

2. **Python Code Execution**
When executing Python code, please output:
<code>
... your code ...
</code>
- The working directory is `/workspace`
- Executing dangerous, destructive, or time-consuming code is prohibited.
- If both a **Tool Call** and **Python Code Execution** are included in the output, the tool call takes precedence, and the Python code will not be executed.
- Using outdated or limited python libraries may result in incomplete or inaccurate observations (e.g. missing images from PDFs or failing to extract key content). Always prefer robust, modern libraries to ensure full and reliable results.
- When performing file conversion or data extraction, always ensure **data integrity**. Verify that the structure, content, and critical fields of the source file are preserved in the output. Check row and column counts, headers, and key values before and after processing. **Avoid silent loss**, truncation, or unintended alteration of data.

## Action Execution Result Processing
- After each action is executed, an Observation is returned, which includes:
    1. `<tool_response>`: The result of the tool or code execution.
    2. `<tool_instruction>`: The instruction associated with a specific action, used to guide the next step or restrict subsequent behavior.
- **Note**: Do not fabricate observations.

## Security and Restrictions
- **Coding Actions (such as Python, CMD, etc.)**
    - Do not run high-risk operations that are large in code size or take a long time.
    - Do not execute code that could cause data loss, system damage, or irreversible changes.
    - Do not use the kill command with wildcards like * or other dangerous parameters that could result in a wide range of matches.
    - Prefer using the Python interpreter to execute code (safer and more efficient) rather than using the CMD tool.

> ⚠️ **Important**
> When your output contains content that fully conforms to the **Tool Call** or **Python Code Execution** format, the system will immediately parse, identify, and execute it as an **Action** without further confirmation and without reversal.
> Therefore, before outputting, always confirm that this is your **intended** action and fully assess the potential consequences and risks.
> If you are only using **quotes, demonstrations, or examples**, be sure to break the formatting or escape it to prevent the system from interpreting it as a real action.

# OBJECTIVE #
Your core objective is to independently and efficiently complete the tasks assigned to you by the company.


# MEMORY #
During previous tasks, you have accumulated the following reusable knowledge:

## Resolution Patterns
Comprehensive Contextualization: Systematically acquire and aggregate information from diverse, potentially unstructured sources, prioritizing local processing and cross-validation, to ensure a complete, coherent operational view and inform robust decisions.
Robust External Interaction: Prioritize stable, predictable interaction methods, such as structured APIs, and dynamically adapt strategies to ensure continuity and reliability with external systems despite their inconsistencies or volatility.
Adaptive Constraint Handling: When an objective is blocked by an unresolvable external constraint, acknowledge the limitation, perform necessary cleanup of partial artifacts, and adapt the strategy to proceed with viable data, avoiding unproductive retries.
Modular Resilient Design: Decompose operations into modular, decoupled units with explicit state management, to enhance predictability, isolate errors, improve maintainability, and ensure operational continuity.
Progressive Verification: Implement multi-stage validation, from granular checks within pipelines to comprehensive outcome validation, to localize errors, confirm system states, and ensure successful execution.

## Platform/Application Operation Guides
These guides summarize proven operation paths derived from past successful experiences.  
Each item is a structured reference designed to help you complete operations more quickly, accurately, and with reduced redundancy.

> This directory provides a comprehensive index of guides, compiling best practices and experience summaries for accomplishing various tasks.

### Recommended Usage Process
1. **Review the Guide First**  
   Before starting a task, browse the relevant entries in the directory to identify potentially useful guidance.  
2. **Targeted Access**  
   Use the `access_the_application_guide` tool to view detailed steps if necessary.  
3. **Reuse with Flexibility**  
   Apply past successful steps when they fit the current situation, but stay aware of possible mismatches.  
4. **Explore When Deviations Arise**  
   If the environment or results diverge from the guide, stop rigidly following it and explore alternative approaches through small, safe, and adaptive steps.

### Value of Guides
- Reduce task completion time by leveraging accumulated experience.  
- Lower error rates and avoid common pitfalls.  
- Ensure consistent, professional execution of tasks.  

### Guide Reliability & Adaptation
- Guides may be outdated, biased, or contain errors — they are “historical experience,” not absolute truth.  
- Use guides as starting points, not as strict rules.  
- When deviations or conflicts appear, **exit the guide and explore new paths** instead of persisting.  
- Record useful deviation points for later improvement of the guides.

<task>
As a financial consultant, one of your daily tasks is to help our employees with their adhoc tax questions.

Huang Jie, your coworker who is a foreigner working in the US, is not sure if they need to report their income as tax resident or non-resident. They know the rules to testify substantial presence, but they are not sure how many days they stayed in the U.S. in 2023. Under /workspace folder, you could find their travel history in 2023. Please analyze the travel history, compute the exact number of days they stayed in the U.S. in 2023. The travel history is copied from i94 official website, except that their arrival and departure dates in other years are not included.

Please reach out to Huang on RocketChat (http://the-agent-company.com:3000/) and tell them the answer. Note: for substantial presence test purpose, do count the days of entry and departure as full days.
</task>
03. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================
* The information you know and have obtained is:
    1. The task is to determine the number of days Huang Jie stayed in the U.S. in 2023 for tax residency purposes.
    2. I need to find Huang Jie's travel history file in the `/workspace` folder.
    3. I need to count both entry and departure days as full days.
    4. I need to communicate the answer to Huang Jie on RocketChat at `http://the-agent-company.com:3000/`.
    5. I have the RocketChat login credentials: email `theagentcompany`, password `theagentcompany`.

* The task can be divided into the following subtasks:
    1. LocateTravelHistoryFile: Identify the specific file containing Huang Jie's travel history for 2023 within the /workspace directory.
    2. ExtractAndParseTravelData: Read the content of the identified travel history file and parse the relevant arrival and departure dates for 2023 into a structured format (e.g., a list of dictionaries or tuples).
    3. CalculateUSStayDays: Compute the total number of days Huang Jie stayed in the U.S. in 2023, ensuring both entry and departure days are counted as full days, and store this final count.
    4. LoginToRocketChat: Successfully log in to the RocketChat platform using the provided credentials.
    5. CommunicateAnswerToHuangJie: Locate Huang Jie on RocketChat and send them the calculated number of days they stayed in the U.S. in 2023.

SubTask1: LocateTravelHistoryFile
Goal: Identify the specific file containing Huang Jie's travel history for 2023 within the /workspace directory.
05. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================
Thought: The first step is to locate the travel history file for Huang Jie in the `/workspace` directory. I will use the `System` guide to find relevant entries. Specifically, `LocateFile` seems to be the most direct way to find the file. I will also check `ReadFile` and `VerifyFileExistenceShell` as they might be useful for confirming the file's content or existence.
Action:
<tool_call>
{"name": "access_the_application_guide", "arguments": {"application_name": "System", "item_names": ["LocateFile", "ReadFile", "VerifyFileExistenceShell"]}}

07. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================
Thought: I have accessed the `System` guides for `LocateFile`, `ReadFile`, and `VerifyFileExistenceShell`. The `LocateFile` guide suggests using the `find` command to search for files. Since I know the file should be in `/workspace` and it's related to "Huang Jie" and "travel history", I will try to find files containing "travel" or "i94" in their names within the `/workspace` directory. I will start by listing all files in `/workspace` to get an idea of what's there.

For successful commands, process `command_result.stdout`. *Note: `command_result.stderr` may contain non-error information; evaluate contextually.* **Crucially, for any sequence of shell commands or when integrating shell output with Python logic, *always encapsulate the entire interaction within a single Python script using `subprocess`* for maximum robustness and control, rather than relying on discrete `run_cmd` calls or shell features like redirection.**

19. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================
Thought: I have reviewed the guides and the content of `travel_history.txt`. The data is structured in blocks of date, event type, and sometimes location/empty lines. I need to parse this into a list of dictionaries containing `date` (as a `datetime` object) and `type` (Arrival/Departure). I will use Python to read the file, split the lines, and then iterate through them to extract the relevant information.

The `travel_history.txt` content is:
```
2023-09-24
Arrival
SEA

2023-09-08
Departure
SEA

2023-04-23
Arrival
SEA

2023-04-15
Departure
SEA

2023-04-09
Arrival
PHY

2023-04-08
Departure
813

2023-02-07
Arrival
SEA
```
It seems each event consists of 3 lines: date, type, and location. There's an extra blank line between events. The last event only has date and type. I need to handle this parsing carefully. I will iterate through the lines and extract date and type based on their patterns.

I will write a Python script to perform this parsing.

Title: Subtask Completion Verification Report: ExtractAndParseTravelData

Checklist Details:
1.  **Check Step: verify_python_execution_and_output**
    *   **Goal**: Confirm that the Python code executed by the Task Agent successfully produced the `stdout` string as reported in `05. USER MESSAGE`.
    *   **Task Agent's Observation (05. USER MESSAGE)**: The `tool_response` clearly shows `execution_status: CODE_EXECUTED` with `returncode: 0` and the `stdout` field containing the expected list of dictionaries.
    *   **Verification Analysis**: My direct examination of `05. USER MESSAGE` confirms the presence and content of the `stdout` field, which precisely matches the expected output of the Python script.
    *   **Result**: **PASSED**

2.  **Check Step: validate_parsed_data_structure**
    *   **Goal**: Verify that the `stdout` string represents a valid Python list of dictionaries, where each dictionary contains 'date' (a `datetime.date` object) and 'type' (a string, either 'Arrival' or 'Departure'), conforming to the specified structured format.
    *   **Task Agent's Observation (05. USER MESSAGE)**: The `stdout` string `[{'date': datetime.date(2023, 9, 24), 'type': 'Arrival'}, ...]` is presented.
    *   **Verification Action & Observation**: I executed a Python script to parse the `stdout` string and programmatically validate its structure, data types, and content. The script successfully parsed the data and confirmed that it is a list of dictionaries, each containing a `datetime.date` object for 'date' and a string ('Arrival'/'Departure') for 'type'. The output of my verification script was `Is valid structure: True`.
    *   **Result**: **PASSED**

3.  **Check Step: cross_reference_parsed_data_content**
    *   **Goal**: Compare the extracted dates and event types from the parsed data (from `stdout`) against the original content of `/workspace/travel_history.txt` (as provided in `04. ASSISTANT MESSAGE`) to ensure accuracy and completeness of the parsing.
    *   **Task Agent's Observation (04. ASSISTANT MESSAGE)**: The Task Agent explicitly provided the content of `travel_history.txt` for reference. (05. USER MESSAGE): The `stdout` of the parsing script contains the processed data.
    *   **Verification Analysis**: I performed a manual comparison between the content of `travel_history.txt` as displayed in `04. ASSISTANT MESSAGE` and the `stdout` of the Python script in `05. USER MESSAGE`. All seven travel events (date and type) from the original file were accurately extracted and represented in the parsed data, maintaining their order and correctness. No relevant information was lost.
    *   **Result**: **PASSED**

Conclusion:
Based on the successful verification across all three check steps, it is confirmed that the Task Agent has accurately parsed the content of `/workspace/travel_history.txt` into the required structured format (a list of dictionaries with date and event type). Therefore, the Subtask "ExtractAndParseTravelData" is **complete and meets expectations**.

2.  **Check Step: validate_calculated_days_accuracy**
    *   **Goal**: Verify the accuracy of the calculated `total_days_in_us` by independently re-running the calculation logic with the provided `travel_events` data.
    *   **Task Agent's Observation**: The Task Agent reported a `Final Answer: 306` in `06. ASSISTANT MESSAGE` and its script produced `stdout: "Total days Huang Jie stayed in the U.S. in 2023: 306"` in `05. USER MESSAGE`. The Python code used for calculation is provided in `04. ASSISTANT MESSAGE`.
    *   **Verification Action & Observation**: I independently executed the Python code logic provided by the Task Agent (from `04. ASSISTANT MESSAGE`) and modified it to explicitly print the result. My execution returned `stdout: "Calculated_Total_Days: 306"`. Furthermore, I performed a manual step-by-step calculation of the days based on the travel events (from `04. ASSISTANT MESSAGE`) and the rule that both arrival and departure days count as full days. The manual calculation also resulted in 306 days (61 + 7 + 139 + 99 = 306). Both my independent code execution and manual verification confirm the Task Agent's calculated value.
    *   **Result**: **PASSED**

Conclusion:
Based on the successful verification of both the Python script's execution and the accuracy of the calculated total days in the U.S., it is confirmed that the Task Agent has correctly computed the exact number of days Huang Jie stayed in the U.S. in 2023.

If an `Element index does not exist` error is returned, it indicates extreme element volatility. **Always re-evaluate `webpage interactive elements` with `browser_wait_and_get_update` immediately before attempting a click, and crucially, confirm the element's `text` or `aria-label` attribute semantically matches the intended target.** If direct clicking by index proves unreliable, *especially within dynamic lists or sidebars (e.g., chat contact lists)*, consider alternative strategies like using an application's built-in search functionality or `browser_go_to_url` if a direct link is known, rather than repeatedly retrying. For form submissions or general action triggers, `browser_send_keys` with 'Enter' is a more robust alternative and **highly recommended for reliability**.

Thought: I have successfully clicked the login button. The `webpage accessibility tree` and `webpage interactive elements` now show elements like "Home", "Search", "Directory", "Channels", and direct messages like "mike_chen" and "chen_xinyi".

Title: Subtask Completion Verification Report: LoginToRocketChat

Checklist Details:
1.  **Check Step: verify_login_form_elements_absence**
    *   **Goal**: Confirm that after the login attempt, the login form elements (e.g., username input, password input, login button) are no longer present in the `webpage interactive elements`, indicating a transition away from the login page.
    *   **Task Agent's Observation**: The `webpage interactive elements` provided in `11. USER MESSAGE` no longer contain the input fields with placeholders "Email or username" or "Password", nor the login button. This is in contrast to `05. USER MESSAGE` where these elements were clearly present with indices 4, 6, and 7 respectively.
    *   **Verification Analysis**: My examination of the `webpage interactive elements` in `11. USER MESSAGE` confirms that the elements associated with the login form (username/email input, password input, and login button) are entirely absent from the list. This directly indicates that the browser has moved past the login screen.
    *   **Result**: **PASSED**.

2.  **Check Step: verify_post_login_dashboard_elements_presence**
    *   **Goal**: Confirm that elements characteristic of a successful RocketChat dashboard (e.g., 'Home', 'Search', 'Channels', or 'Welcome to Rocket.Chat' headings) are present in the `webpage accessibility tree` or `webpage interactive elements`, indicating that the user has successfully navigated to the post-login state.
    *   **Task Agent's Observation**: The `webpage accessibility tree` in `11. USER MESSAGE` explicitly lists elements such as `button 'Home'`, `button 'Search'`, `region 'Channels'`, and `heading 'Welcome to Rocket.Chat', level=1`.
    *   **Verification Analysis**: The presence of these specific and characteristic dashboard elements within the `webpage accessibility tree` in `11. USER MESSAGE` (e.g., "Home", "Search" buttons, "Channels" region, and "Welcome to Rocket.Chat" heading) definitively confirms that the RocketChat application has successfully loaded its main interface, indicating a complete and successful login.
    *   **Result**: **PASSED**.

Conclusion:
Based on the successful verification across both check steps—confirming the absence of login form elements and the presence of characteristic post-login dashboard elements—it is confirmed that the Task Agent has successfully logged into the RocketChat platform. Therefore, the Subtask "LoginToRocketChat" is **complete and meets expectations**.

As a financial consultant, one of your daily tasks is to help our employees with their adhoc tax questions.

Huang Jie, your coworker who is a foreigner working in the US, is not sure if they need to report their income as tax resident or non-resident. They know the rules to testify substantial presence, but they are not sure how many days they stayed in the U.S. in 2023. Under /workspace folder, you could find their travel history in 2023. Please analyze the travel history, compute the exact number of days they stayed in the U.S. in 2023. The travel history is copied from i94 official website, except that their arrival and departure dates in other years are not included.

Please reach out to Huang on RocketChat (http://the-agent-company.com:3000/) and tell them the answer. Note: for substantial presence test purpose, do count the days of entry and departure as full days.

Checklist Details:
1.  **Check Step: verify_conversation_context**
    *   **Goal**: Confirm that the browser successfully navigated to the direct message conversation with 'huang_jie' on RocketChat, as indicated by the URL and page title/headings.
    *   **Task Agent's Observation (09. USER MESSAGE)**: The `tool_response` shows the URL as `http://the-agent-company.com:3000/direct/CZYWHd5bCmhj5YcFeTAh4ug5jgz97QthJ2` and the `webpage accessibility tree` contains `heading 'huang_jie', level=1`.
    *   **Verification Analysis**: The URL clearly indicates a direct message, and the prominent heading `huang_jie` confirms the correct conversation context.
    *   **Result**: **PASSED**.

2.  **Check Step: verify_message_input**
    *   **Goal**: Ensure that the intended message text was correctly populated into the chat's message input field before the send action.
    *   **Task Agent's Observation (11. USER MESSAGE)**: The `tool_response` states "Performed browser action: ⌨️ Input Hi Huang Jie..." into index 72. The `webpage accessibility tree` for `textbox 'Message'` (index 72) contains `StaticText "Hi Huang Jie, I've calculated the number of days you stayed in the U.S. in 2023 for tax purposes. It's 306 days. This counts both your entry and departure days as full days."`.
    *   **Verification Analysis**: The `StaticText` within the message input `textbox` directly matches the intended message, confirming successful population.
    *   **Result**: **PASSED**.

3.  **Check Step: verify_message_sent_and_displayed**
    *   **Goal**: Validate that the complete message, including the calculated days, is visible within the chat history of the RocketChat interface, indicating successful transmission and display.
    *   **Task Agent's Observation (13. USER MESSAGE)**: The `webpage accessibility tree` clearly shows a `paragraph` element containing the full message: "Hi Huang Jie, I've calculated the number of days you stayed in the U.S. in 2023 for tax purposes. It's 306 days. This counts both your entry and departure days as full days.", preceded by `StaticText 'theagentcompany'` (sender username) and a timestamp.
    *   **Verification Analysis**: The presence of the complete message as a distinct paragraph in the chat history, along with sender and timestamp, confirms that the message was successfully sent and displayed.
    *   **Result**: **PASSED**.

4.  **Check Step: verify_input_field_cleared**
    *   **Goal**: Confirm that the message input field is empty or cleared after the message was sent, which is a common indicator of successful message submission.
    *   **Task Agent's Observation (13. USER MESSAGE)**: The `webpage accessibility tree` for the `textbox 'Message'` shows no `StaticText` content, and the `webpage interactive elements` for the `textarea` (index 74) shows an empty `text` attribute.
    *   **Verification Analysis**: The absence of text content in both the accessibility tree and interactive elements for the message input field confirms that it was cleared after sending, as expected.
    *   **Result**: **PASSED**.

Conclusion:
Based on the successful verification across all four check steps, confirming the correct navigation to Huang Jie's direct message, the accurate input of the message, the successful display of the message in the chat history, and the clearing of the input field, it is confirmed that the Task Agent has successfully communicated the answer to Huang Jie on RocketChat.
