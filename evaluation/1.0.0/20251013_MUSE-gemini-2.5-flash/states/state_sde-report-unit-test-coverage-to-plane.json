The `.git` directory is present within `/workspace/openhands`, as shown by the `ls -a /workspace/openhands` command, confirming it is a valid Git repository.\n3.  **Verify Remote Origin URL**: Confirmed. The `git -C /workspace/openhands remote -v` command output shows `origin http://the-agent-company.com:8929/root/openhands (fetch)` and `origin http://the-agent-company.com:8929/root/openhands (push)`, indicating the correct remote origin.\n\nConclusion:\nThe Subtask \"Clone Openhands Repository\" is complete.

Create an issue on http://the-agent-company.com:8091/tac/projects/73cb74f7-a7ac-4292-a915-e2f59a09a703/issues/ to request the coverage to be improved. The issue title should follow the format \"Openhands unit test coverage xx.xx%, needs to be improved\", where the coverage value should be displayed with 2 decimal places. \n</task>\nAlso, the status of the Subtasks previously executed by the Task Agent is as follows:\n<done_subtasks>\n[{'name': 'Clone Openhands Repository', 'index': 1, 'goal': \"The 'openhands' repository will be successfully cloned from http://the-agent-company.com:8929/root/openhands into the /workspace directory.\", 'finish': True, 'check_report': 'Title: Subtask 1: Clone Openhands Repository Verification Report\\n\\nChecklist Details:\\n1.  **Verify Cloned Directory Exists**: Confirmed. The directory `/workspace/openhands` exists and contains files, as evidenced by the Task Agent\\'s `ls -F /workspace/openhands` command output in step 7, which listed repository contents such as `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, etc.\\n2.  **Verify Git Repository Structure**: Confirmed. The `.git` directory is present within `/workspace/openhands`, as shown by the `ls -a /workspace/openhands` command, confirming it is a valid Git repository.\\n3.  **Verify Remote Origin URL**: Confirmed. The `git -C /workspace/openhands remote -v` command output shows `origin http://the-agent-company.com:8929/root/openhands (fetch)` and `origin http://the-agent-company.com:8929/root/openhands (push)`, indicating the correct remote origin.\\n\\nConclusion:\\nThe Subtask \"Clone Openhands Repository\" is complete.

I will start by examining the project's root directory for common dependency files like `pyproject.toml`, `poetry.lock`, `requirements.txt`, or `Makefile`. I will use `System: ExecuteShellCommand` to list files and potentially `System: ReadFile` to inspect their contents. If it's a Python project, `System: InstallPythonPackage` might be relevant.\n\nI will begin by listing the contents of the `/workspace/openhands` directory to identify relevant files.\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"access_the_application_guide\", \"arguments\": {\"batch_requests\": {\"System\": [\"ExecuteShellCommand\", \"ReadFile\", \"InstallPythonPackage\"]}}}\n</tool_call>\n03. | ================================================== USER MESSAGE ==================================================\nObservation: \n<tool_response>\n<Application name=\"System\">\n<ExecuteShellCommand>\n{'preconditions': 'The command to be executed is a valid shell command and the system has necessary binaries.

Analyze `stderr` for errors, `stdout` for output. `run_cmd` operates in isolated environments; `cd` does not persist across `run_cmd` calls.

The presence of `pyproject.toml` and `poetry.lock` suggests that the project uses Poetry for dependency management. The next logical step is to install Poetry and then use it to install the project's dependencies. First, I will check if Poetry is installed. If not, I will install it using `pip`.

Verify row/column counts, headers, and key values before and after processing to confirm completeness. \n"

The task's goal for this subtask is to \"Run unit tests and generate a coverage report, and display it in the console output.\" This has been achieved, as the coverage report is present in the output. The total coverage is `34%`.\n\nI will now extract this coverage percentage using a Python script, as suggested by the `tool_instruction` for integrating shell output with Python logic. This will complete the current subtask.\nFinal Answer: The unit tests were executed, and a code coverage report was generated and displayed in the console output. The total coverage is 34%.\n\n</Task Agent Execution Trajectory>\n\n# Check Plan Design Principles\n\n## Global Rules\n- **Timeliness Check**: Check only the current Subtask; data and conclusions from **previous Subtasks** do not need to be verified.\n- **First-Principles Verification Process**: Always adapt the depth of checking to Subtask complexity, prioritize the most relevant aspects of Subtask goal, and avoid unnecessary or low-relevance checks.  \n\n### Complexity Reference\nDesign num of checks according to Subtask complexity:\n- **Low complexity**: design ≤ 2 checks\n- **Medium complexity**: design ≤ 4 checks\n- **High complexity**: design ≤ 6 checks\n\n## Selective Check Dimensions (choose based on Subtask goal & complexity)\n1. **Authenticity Verification**: Ensure that all Subtask conclusions are derived from **real-world feedback**—specifically, Observation generated by the Task Agent through action execution—and that the extracted data remains consistent with the original (unless explicitly requested to revise), rather than being fabricated or speculative.\n2. **Process and Result Consistency**: For tasks involving file operations, verify that the workspace files exist, that the content is correct, and that they meet the requirements.\n3. **Product Deliverable Requirements Verification**: If a Subtask requires a deliverable (report, data, file, etc.), verify not only the existence of the deliverable, but also the completeness of the content, the correct format, and that it meets the task requirements (for example, whether the generated link is publicly accessible and whether the generated script file is executable).\n4. **Data Integrity and Completeness**: When converting, extracting, or transforming files/data, ensure that no information is silently lost, truncated, or altered. Verify row/column counts, headers, and key values before and after processing to confirm completeness. \n"

`aria-label` attribute semantically matches the intended target.** If direct clicking by index proves unreliable, *especially within dynamic lists or sidebars (e.g., chat contact lists)*, consider alternative strategies like using an application's built-in search functionality or `browser_go_to_url` if a direct link is known, rather than repeatedly retrying. For form submissions or general action triggers, `browser_send_keys` with 'Enter' is a more robust alternative and **highly recommended for reliability**.\n</tool_instruction>\n"

crucially, confirm the element's `text` or `aria-label` attribute semantically matches the intended target.** If direct clicking by index proves unreliable, *especially within dynamic lists or sidebars (e.g., chat contact lists)*, consider alternative strategies like using an application's built-in search functionality or `browser_go_to_url` if a direct link is known, rather than repeatedly retrying. For form submissions or general action triggers, `browser_send_keys` with 'Enter' is a more robust alternative and **highly recommended for reliability**.\n</tool_instruction>\n"

indicates extreme element volatility. **Always re-evaluate `webpage interactive elements` with `browser_wait_and_get_update` immediately before attempting a click, and crucially, confirm the element's `text` or `aria-label` attribute semantically matches the intended target.** If direct clicking by index proves unreliable, *especially within dynamic lists or sidebars (e.g., chat contact lists)*, consider alternative strategies like using an application's built-in search functionality or `browser_go_to_url` if a direct link is known, rather than repeatedly retrying. For form submissions or general action triggers, `browser_send_keys` with 'Enter' is a more robust alternative and **highly recommended for reliability**.\n</tool_instruction>\n"

exist` error is returned, it indicates extreme element volatility. **Always re-evaluate `webpage interactive elements` with `browser_wait_and_get_update` immediately before attempting a click, and crucially, confirm the element's `text` or `aria-label` attribute semantically matches the intended target.** If direct clicking by index proves unreliable, *especially within dynamic lists or sidebars (e.g., chat contact lists)*, consider alternative strategies like using an application's built-in search functionality or `browser_go_to_url` if a direct link is known, rather than repeatedly retrying. For form submissions or general action triggers, `browser_send_keys` with 'Enter' is a more robust alternative and **highly recommended for reliability**.\n</tool_instruction>\n\n14. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================\nThought: I have successfully logged in to Plane.

with `browser_wait_and_get_update` immediately before attempting a click, and crucially, confirm the element's `text` or `aria-label` attribute semantically matches the intended target.** If direct clicking by index proves unreliable, *especially within dynamic lists or sidebars (e.g., chat contact lists)*, consider alternative strategies like using an application's built-in search functionality or `browser_go_to_url` if a direct link is known, rather than repeatedly retrying. For form submissions or general action triggers, `browser_send_keys` with 'Enter' is a more robust alternative and **highly recommended for reliability**.\n</tool_instruction>\n\n18. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================\nThought: I have successfully clicked the \"Add Issue\" button, and now I see the \"Create Issue\" dialog.

elements>\n\n</tool_response>\n<tool_instruction>\nIf an `Element index does not exist` error is returned, it indicates extreme element volatility. **Always re-evaluate `webpage interactive elements` with `browser_wait_and_get_update` immediately before attempting a click, and crucially, confirm the element's `text` or `aria-label` attribute semantically matches the intended target.** If direct clicking by index proves unreliable, *especially within dynamic lists or sidebars (e.g., chat contact lists)*, consider alternative strategies like using an application's built-in search functionality or `browser_go_to_url` if a direct link is known, rather than repeatedly retrying. For form submissions or general action triggers, `browser_send_keys` with 'Enter' is a more robust alternative and **highly recommended for reliability**.\n</tool_instruction>\n\n22. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================\nThought: I have successfully clicked the \"Create Issue\" button. The page has refreshed, and I can now see the newly created issue \"Openhands unit test coverage 34.00%, needs to be improved\" listed on the issues page. This confirms that the issue has been successfully created. Therefore, this subtask is complete.\nFinal Answer: A new issue has been successfully created on Plane at http://the-agent-company.com:8091/tac/projects/73cb74f7-a7ac-4292-a915-e2f59a09a703/issues/ with the title 'Openhands unit test coverage 34.00%, needs to be improved'.\n\n</Task Agent Execution Trajectory>\n\n# Check Plan Design Principles\n\n## Global Rules\n- **Timeliness Check**: Check only the current Subtask; data and conclusions from **previous Subtasks** do not need to be verified.\n- **First-Principles Verification Process**: Always adapt the depth of checking to Subtask complexity, prioritize the most relevant aspects of Subtask goal, and avoid unnecessary or low-relevance checks.  \n\n### Complexity Reference\nDesign num of checks according to Subtask complexity:\n- **Low complexity**: design ≤ 2 checks\n- **Medium complexity**: design ≤ 4 checks\n- **High complexity**: design ≤ 6 checks\n\n## Selective Check Dimensions (choose based on Subtask goal & complexity)\n1. **Authenticity Verification**: Ensure that all Subtask conclusions are derived from **real-world feedback**—specifically, Observation generated by the Task Agent through action execution—and that the extracted data remains consistent with the original (unless explicitly requested to revise), rather than being fabricated or speculative.\n2. **Process and Result Consistency**: For tasks involving file operations, verify that the workspace files exist, that the content is correct, and that they meet the requirements.\n3. **Product Deliverable Requirements Verification**: If a Subtask requires a deliverable (report, data, file, etc.), verify not only the existence of the deliverable, but also the completeness of the content, the correct format, and that it meets the task requirements (for example, whether the generated link is publicly accessible and whether the generated script file is executable).\n4. **Data Integrity and Completeness**: When converting, extracting, or transforming files/data, ensure that no information is silently lost, truncated, or altered. Verify row/column counts, headers, and key values before and after processing to confirm completeness. \n"
