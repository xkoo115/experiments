You can use the default command to build the distribution archive to also build the docker images.\\n```\\nmvn clean install -Pjanusgraph-release -Dgpg.skip=true -DskipTests=true\\n```\\n\\n## Building on Eclipse IDE\\nNote that this has only been tested on Eclipse Neon.2 Release (4.6.2) with m2e (1.7.0.20160603-1933) and m2e-wtp (1.3.1.20160831-1005) plugin.\\n\\n\\nTo build without executing tests:\\n\\n1. Right-click on your project -> \\\"Run As...\\\" -> \\\"Run Configurations...\\\"\\n2. On \\\"Goals\\\", populate with `install`\\n3. Select the options `Update Snapshots` and `Skip Tests`\\n4. Before clicking \\\"Run\\\", make sure that Eclipse knows where `JAVA_HOME` is. On same window, go to \\\"Environment\\\" tab and click \\\"New\\\".\\n5. Under \\\"Name:\\\", add `JAVA_HOME`\\n6. Under \\\"Value:\\\", add the path where `java` is located\\n7. Click \\\"OK\\\"\\n8. Then click \\\"Run\\\"\\n\\nTo find the Java binary in your environment, run the appropriate command for your operating system:\\n* Linux/macOS: `which java`\\n* Windows: `for %i in (java.exe) do @echo. %~$PATH:i`\\n\\n## Building documentation\\n\\n\\n### Updating documentation\\nYou have check in the actual version of configuration reference. Therefore, you have to run following command:\\n\\n```bash\\nmvn --quiet clean install -DskipTests=true -pl janusgraph-doc -am\\n```\\n\\n### Required dependencies to build the documentation\\nMkDocs need to be installed to build and serve the documentation locally.\\n\\n1. Install `python3` and `pip3` (newest version of pip) \\n    * You can also checkout the installation guide of [material-mkdocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/getting-started/)\\n2. Install requirements using `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`\\n\\n### Build and serve documentation\\n\\n1. To create a test build locally use command `mkdocs build`\\n2. To serve the documentation locally use command `mkdocs serve`\",\n  \"stderr\": \"\"\n}\n</tool_response>\n<tool_instruction>\nAlways check `command_result.returncode`: `0` indicates success; non-zero suggests an error; analyze `command_result.stderr`.

Therefore, this subtask cannot be completed as intended within the given constraints.

This confirms Maven is installed and accessible, which was a prerequisite for building. (Refer to the tool_response after step 1 of the verification agent's action).\n2.  **check_for_build_artifacts**:\n    *   **Goal**: Verify the absence of expected build artifacts (e.g., 'janusgraph-dist/target/janusgraph-*.zip' or 'janusgraph-dist/target/*.jar') within the '/workspace/janusgraph' directory.\n    *   **Verification**: Executed `find /workspace/janusgraph/janusgraph-dist/target -name \"janusgraph-*.zip\" -o -name \"*.jar\"`.\n    *   **Result**: The command returned `returncode: 1` and `stderr` containing \"find: ‘/workspace/janusgraph/janusgraph-dist/target’: No such file or directory\". This indicates that the target directory for build artifacts does not exist, and therefore, no build artifacts were created. This is consistent with the Task Agent's build attempts timing out, as observed in USER MESSAGE observations for steps 13 and 15, both showing `\"execution_status\": \"TOOL_FAILURE_TIMEOUT\"`.\n\nConclusion:\nThe Subtask \"Build JanusGraph binary file\" is **not complete**. Although Maven was successfully installed, the JanusGraph build process repeatedly failed due to command execution timeouts, as evidenced by the `TOOL_FAILURE_TIMEOUT` status in the Task Agent's trajectory (steps 13 and 15). Consequently, no build artifacts were generated, confirmed by the absence of the expected `/workspace/janusgraph/janusgraph-dist/target` directory.\n</check_report>\n\nBased on analyzing the current Subtask, its goal, and **your Subtask's execution trajectory**, the Check Agent reports that the current Subtask has failed to complete. The above is the Check Agent's check report.\nPlease combine this check report with the current Subtask's historical execution trajectory to analyze the key obstacles currently hindering task completion and develop an actionable plan for the next steps.\n\n"

This directly confirms the absence of the expected build output directory and consequently, no build artifacts were created. This result is consistent with the Task Agent's repeated `TOOL_FAILURE_TIMEOUT` observations for its build attempts (USER MESSAGE observations for steps 13, 15, and 21).\n\n2.  **check_agent_conclusion_consistency**:\n    *   **Goal**: Confirm that the Task Agent's conclusion regarding the subtask's completion status is consistent with the evidence of repeated build timeouts and the absence of build artifacts.\n    *   **Verification**: Reviewed the Task Agent's trajectory and previous check results.\n    *   **Result**: The Task Agent's final conclusion in step 22, \"The subtask 'Build JanusGraph binary file' cannot be completed. Despite attempts to increase the timeout for the build process, execution persistently times out, indicating a hard environmental limit that cannot be overcome,\" is entirely consistent with its execution trajectory. The agent attempted to build JanusGraph multiple times (steps 12, 14, and 20), and all attempts resulted in `TOOL_FAILURE_TIMEOUT` (observations in steps 13, 15, and 21). This persistent failure, coupled with the confirmed absence of build artifacts from our independent verification, fully supports the agent's assessment that the subtask is not completable within the given environment.\n\nConclusion:\nThe Subtask \"Build JanusGraph binary file\" is **not complete**. The JanusGraph build process consistently timed out, both when executed directly via `run_cmd` and through a Python script with an extended `subprocess` timeout. This led to the confirmed absence of any build artifacts. The Task Agent's conclusion that the subtask is not completable within the current environment's constraints is accurate and supported by all available evidence.\n</check_report>\n\nBased on analyzing the current Subtask, its goal, and **your Subtask's execution trajectory**, the Check Agent reports that the current Subtask has failed to complete. The above is the Check Agent's check report.\nPlease combine this check report with the current Subtask's historical execution trajectory to analyze the key obstacles currently hindering task completion and develop an actionable plan for the next steps.\n\n"

This makes building the binary file locally an unfeasible approach.\n    2. **Absence of Runnable Binary**: As a direct consequence of the failed build, there are no generated binary files or distribution packages available, which are essential for launching the JanusGraph server.\n\n* Consider trying the following actions:\n    1. **Search for Pre-built JanusGraph Distributions**: Instead of building from source, identify and locate official pre-built JanusGraph releases or distributions available for download. This will bypass the computationally intensive build process.\n    2. **Download JanusGraph Distribution**: Once a suitable pre-built distribution (e.g., a `.zip` or `.tar.gz` file) is found, download it to the `/workspace` directory using appropriate tools (e.g., `curl` or `wget` via `run_cmd`, or potentially the browser for direct download if necessary).\n    3. **Extract JanusGraph Distribution**: After downloading, extract the contents of the distribution package into a designated folder within `/workspace` to prepare it for launch."

For any non-trivial shell interaction or complex logic, *always prefer consolidating operations into a single Python script that uses `subprocess` for explicit control and robustness* over multiple `run_cmd` calls or complex shell syntax.** 3) Quote arguments containing spaces (`\\\"path with spaces\\\"`). 4) State changes (`cd`) do not persist across calls.\", \"parameters\": {\"type\": \"object\", \"properties\": {\"command\": {\"type\": \"string\", \"description\": \"shell command string.\"}}, \"required\": [\"command\"]}}}\n</tools>\n\n2. **Python Code Execution**\nWhen executing Python code, please output:\n<code>\n... your code ...\n</code>\n- The working directory is `/workspace`\n- Executing dangerous, destructive, or time-consuming code is prohibited.\n- If both a **Tool Call** and **Python Code Execution** are included in the output, the tool call takes precedence, and the Python code will not be executed.\n\n## Action Execution Result Processing\n- After each action is executed, an Observation is returned, which includes:\n    1. `<tool_response>`: The result of the tool or code execution.\n    2. `<tool_instruction>`: The instruction associated with a specific action, used to guide the next step or restrict subsequent behavior.\n- **Note**: Do not fabricate observations.\n\n## Security and Restrictions\n- **Coding Actions (such as Python, CMD, etc.)**\n    - Do not run high-risk operations that are large in code size or take a long time.\n    - Do not execute code that could cause data loss, system damage, or irreversible changes.\n    - Do not use the kill command with wildcards like * or other dangerous parameters that could result in a wide range of matches.\n    - Prefer using the Python interpreter to execute code (safer and more efficient) rather than using the CMD tool.\n\n> ⚠️ **Important**\n> When your output contains content that fully conforms to the **Tool Call** or **Python Code Execution** format, the system will immediately parse, identify, and execute it as an **Action** without further confirmation and without reversal.\n> Therefore, before outputting, always confirm that this is your **intended** action and fully assess the potential consequences and risks.\n> If you are only using **quotes, demonstrations, or examples**, be sure to break the formatting or escape it to prevent the system from interpreting it as a real action.\n\n# OBJECTIVE #\nYour primary objective is to determine whether the Task Agent has completed its Subtask.\n\n- Judgment Criteria: Use both the Task Agent’s execution traces and your own Action verification results.\n- Evaluation Requirement: Carefully analyze all information in the Observations from Actions.

This task plan aims to complete the following tasks:\n<task>\nYou need to set up JanusGraph and run locally with http endpoint. \n\n1. Clone JanusGraph directory under /workspace folder (http://the-agent-company.com:8929/root/janusgraph)\n2. Build the binary file\n3. Launch JanusGraph server locally on port 8182 with an http endpoint\n</task>\nAlso, the status of the Subtasks previously executed by the Task Agent is as follows:\n<done_subtasks>\n[{'name': 'Clone JanusGraph repository', 'index': 1, 'goal': 'The JanusGraph repository from http://the-agent-company.com:8929/root/janusgraph is successfully cloned into the /workspace directory.', 'finish': True, 'check_report': 'Title: Subtask 1: Clone JanusGraph repository - Verification Report\\n\\nChecklist Details:\\n1.  **verify_directory_and_git_contents**:\\n    *   **Goal**: Confirm that the `/workspace/janusgraph` directory exists and contains the necessary files and a `.git` subdirectory, indicating a successful clone.\\n    *   **Verification**: Executed `ls -aF /workspace/janusgraph`.\\n    *   **Result**: The command successfully listed `.git/` among other files and directories, as observed in the `stdout` of the `tool_response` (step 2 of the verification agent\\'s action).

I have already cloned the repository into `/workspace/janusgraph`. I need to figure out how to build it. Typically, Java projects use Maven or Gradle for building. I will check for a `pom.xml` file (Maven) or `build.gradle` file (Gradle) in the cloned directory. I will also look for any build instructions in the `README.md` or `BUILDING.md` files. The `System` application guide's `ExecuteShellCommand` entry will be useful for running build commands.\nAction:\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"access_the_application_guide\", \"arguments\": {\"batch_requests\": {\"System\": [\"ExecuteShellCommand\"]}}}\n</tool_call>\n03. | ================================================== USER MESSAGE ==================================================\nObservation: \n<tool_response>\n<Application name=\"System\">\n<ExecuteShellCommand>\n{'preconditions': 'The command to be executed is a valid shell command and the system has necessary binaries.

Analyze `stderr` for errors, `stdout` for output. `run_cmd` operates in isolated environments; `cd` does not persist across `run_cmd` calls. When using `subprocess`, use `check=True` to raise `CalledProcessError` on non-zero exit codes for robust error handling. `capture_output=True` is essential for getting stdout/stderr.\"}\n</ExecuteShellCommand>\n</Application>\n</tool_response>\n<tool_instruction>\nAfter accessing, carefully read the guide content.

Although the `tool_instruction` suggests using `subprocess` for complex shell commands, the underlying execution environment still imposes a hard timeout that cannot be bypassed or extended by the agent. Therefore, this subtask cannot be completed as intended within the given constraints. I must conclude that building the binary file is not feasible in this environment.\nFinal Answer: The subtask \"Build JanusGraph binary file\" cannot be completed due to persistent command execution timeouts, indicating that the build process exceeds the environment's allowed execution time.\n17. | ================================================== USER MESSAGE ==================================================\n<check_report>\nTitle: Subtask 2: Build JanusGraph binary file - Verification Report\n\nChecklist Details:\n1.  **verify_maven_installation**:\n    *   **Goal**: Confirm that Maven is correctly installed and accessible by running 'mvn --version'.\n    *   **Verification**: Executed `mvn --version`.\n    *   **Result**: The command successfully returned with `returncode: 0` and `stdout` indicating \"Apache Maven 3.6.3\" and \"Java version: 11.0.28\". This confirms Maven is installed and accessible, which was a prerequisite for building. (Refer to the tool_response after step 1 of the verification agent's action).\n2.  **check_for_build_artifacts**:\n    *   **Goal**: Verify the absence of expected build artifacts (e.g., 'janusgraph-dist/target/janusgraph-*.zip' or 'janusgraph-dist/target/*.jar') within the '/workspace/janusgraph' directory.\n    *   **Verification**: Executed `find /workspace/janusgraph/janusgraph-dist/target -name \"janusgraph-*.zip\" -o -name \"*.jar\"`.\n    *   **Result**: The command returned `returncode: 1` and `stderr` containing \"find: ‘/workspace/janusgraph/janusgraph-dist/target’: No such file or directory\". This indicates that the target directory for build artifacts does not exist, and therefore, no build artifacts were created. This is consistent with the Task Agent's build attempts timing out, as observed in USER MESSAGE observations for steps 13 and 15, both showing `\"execution_status\": \"TOOL_FAILURE_TIMEOUT\"`.\n\nConclusion:\nThe Subtask \"Build JanusGraph binary file\" is **not complete**. Although Maven was successfully installed, the JanusGraph build process repeatedly failed due to command execution timeouts, as evidenced by the `TOOL_FAILURE_TIMEOUT` status in the Task Agent's trajectory (steps 13 and 15). Consequently, no build artifacts were generated, confirmed by the absence of the expected `/workspace/janusgraph/janusgraph-dist/target` directory.\n</check_report>\n\nBased on analyzing the current Subtask, its goal, and **your Subtask's execution trajectory**, the Check Agent reports that the current Subtask has failed to complete. The above is the Check Agent's check report.\nPlease combine this check report with the current Subtask's historical execution trajectory to analyze the key obstacles currently hindering task completion and develop an actionable plan for the next steps.\n\n\n18. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================\n* The current Subtask still has the following issues:\n    1. The `mvn clean install -DskipTests` command timed out, preventing the JanusGraph binary from being built.\n    2. The default execution timeout for `run_cmd` is insufficient for the JanusGraph build process.\n\n* Consider trying the following actions:\n    1. Create a Python script that uses `subprocess.run` to execute the `mvn clean install -DskipTests` command with a significantly increased timeout (e.g., 1200 seconds or 20 minutes).\n    2. Execute this Python script using `run_cmd` to build JanusGraph.\n19. | ================================================== USER MESSAGE ==================================================\nSubTask2: Build JanusGraph binary file\nGoal: The JanusGraph project is successfully built, and the necessary binary files (e.g., JARs, distribution archives) are created and located, ready for server launch.\nThe goal of this subtask has not been achieved yet, please continue\n20. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================\n<code>\nimport subprocess\nimport os\n\nbuild_command = \"mvn clean install -Pjanusgraph-release -Dgpg.skip=true -DskipTests=true\"\njanusgraph_dir = \"/workspace/janusgraph\"\n\n# Change directory before running the command\nos.chdir(janusgraph_dir)\n\ntry:\n    print(f\"Attempting to build JanusGraph with command: {build_command}\")\n    # Using a timeout of 1200 seconds (20 minutes)\n    result = subprocess.run(\n        build_command,\n        shell=True,\n        check=True,\n        capture_output=True,\n        text=True,\n        timeout=1200  # Increased timeout to 20 minutes\n    )\n    print(\"Build successful.\")\n    print(\"STDOUT:\")\n    print(result.stdout)\n    print(\"STDERR:\")\n    print(result.stderr)\nexcept subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:\n    print(f\"Build failed with error code {e.returncode}\")\n    print(\"STDOUT:\")\n    print(e.stdout)\n    print(\"STDERR:\")\n    print(e.stderr)\n    exit(1)\nexcept subprocess.TimeoutExpired:\n    print(\"Build command timed out after 1200 seconds.\")\n    exit(1)\nexcept Exception as e:\n    print(f\"An unexpected error occurred: {e}\")\n    exit(1)\n\n</code>\n21. | ================================================== USER MESSAGE ==================================================\nObservation: \n<tool_response>\n{\n  \"execution_status\": \"TOOL_FAILURE_TIMEOUT\",\n  \"stderr\": \"代码执行超时 (在 270 秒后被终止)。\"\n}\n</tool_response>\n<tool_instruction>\n\n</tool_instruction>\n\n22. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================\nThought: The Python script using `subprocess.run` with an extended timeout also failed due to a timeout, even though I explicitly set it to 1200 seconds. This strongly indicates that there is a hard, unalterable execution timeout imposed by the environment itself, independent of my code or tool calls. Given that the JanusGraph build process is a long-running task, it is not feasible to complete this subtask within the current environment's constraints. I cannot build the binary file under these conditions. The subtask cannot be completed.\nFinal Answer: The subtask \"Build JanusGraph binary file\" cannot be completed. Despite attempts to increase the timeout for the build process, execution persistently times out, indicating a hard environmental limit that cannot be overcome.\n\n</Task Agent Execution Trajectory>\n\n# Check Plan Design Principles\n\n## Global Rules\n- **Timeliness Check**: Check only the current Subtask; data and conclusions from **previous Subtasks** do not need to be verified.\n- **First-Principles Verification Process**: Always adapt the depth of checking to Subtask complexity, prioritize the most relevant aspects of Subtask goal, and avoid unnecessary or low-relevance checks.  \n\n### Complexity Reference\nDesign num of checks according to Subtask complexity:\n- **Low complexity**: design ≤ 2 checks\n- **Medium complexity**: design ≤ 4 checks\n- **High complexity**: design ≤ 6 checks\n\n## Selective Check Dimensions (choose based on Subtask goal & complexity)\n1. **Authenticity Verification**: Ensure that all Subtask conclusions are derived from **real-world feedback**—specifically, Observation generated by the Task Agent through action execution—and that the extracted data remains consistent with the original (unless explicitly requested to revise), rather than being fabricated or speculative.\n2. **Process and Result Consistency**: For tasks involving file operations, verify that the workspace files exist, that the content is correct, and that they meet the requirements.\n3. **Product Deliverable Requirements Verification**: If a Subtask requires a deliverable (report, data, file, etc.), verify not only the existence of the deliverable, but also the completeness of the content, the correct format, and that it meets the task requirements (for example, whether the generated link is publicly accessible and whether the generated script file is executable).\n4. **Data Integrity and Completeness**: When converting, extracting, or transforming files/data, ensure that no information is silently lost, truncated, or altered. Verify row/column counts, headers, and key values before and after processing to confirm completeness. \n"

The `webpage accessibility tree` also showed the root URL as `https://github.com/JanusGraph/janusgraph/releases`. This confirms the URL is accessible and loads correctly.\n2.  **verify_download_links_presence**:\n    *   **Goal**: After navigating to the identified URL, check if there are actual download links for pre-built JanusGraph distributions (e.g., .zip or .tar.gz files) on the page, confirming that the identified URL leads to distribution downloads as per the subtask goal.\n    *   **Verification**: Initially used `browser_extract_content_by_vision` which indicated the \"Assets\" section was not visible. Subsequently performed `browser_scroll` (observation after my second check step) to reveal more content. After scrolling, the `webpage accessibility tree` clearly showed expanded \"Assets\" sections for various releases. For example, under \"1.1.0\", there were explicit links such as `<link 'janusgraph-1.1.0.zip', focusable=True, url='https://github.com/JanusGraph/janusgraph/releases/download/v1.1.0/janusgraph-1.1.0.zip'>` and `<link 'janusgraph-full-1.1.0.zip', focusable=True, url='https://github.com/JanusGraph/janusgraph/releases/download/v1.1.0/janusgraph-full-1.1.0.zip'>`, along with source code `.zip` and `.tar.gz` files.\n    *   **Result**: The presence of these `.zip` and `.tar.gz` download links under the \"Assets\" section confirms that the identified URL indeed leads to pre-built JanusGraph distributions.\n\nConclusion:\nThe Subtask \"Find JanusGraph Distribution Download URL\" is **complete**. The Task Agent successfully identified an accessible URL (`https://github.com/JanusGraph/janusgraph/releases`) that leads directly to the release page containing pre-built JanusGraph distributions in `.zip` and `.tar.gz` formats.\n</check_report>\n\nThe Check Agent reports that the current Subtask has been completed.

The agent attempted to build JanusGraph multiple times (steps 12, 14, and 20), and all attempts resulted in `TOOL_FAILURE_TIMEOUT` (observations in steps 13, 15, and 21). This persistent failure, coupled with the confirmed absence of build artifacts from our independent verification, fully supports the agent\\'s assessment that the subtask is not completable within the given environment.\\n\\nConclusion:\\nThe Subtask \"Build JanusGraph binary file\" is **not complete**. The JanusGraph build process consistently timed out, both when executed directly via `run_cmd` and through a Python script with an extended `subprocess` timeout. This led to the confirmed absence of any build artifacts.

This URL points directly to the JanusGraph releases page on GitHub, where pre-built distributions are typically found. This fulfills the goal of finding a direct download URL for a pre-built JanusGraph distribution.\nFinal Answer: https://github.com/JanusGraph/janusgraph/releases\n\n</Task Agent Execution Trajectory>\n\n# Check Plan Design Principles\n\n## Global Rules\n- **Timeliness Check**: Check only the current Subtask; data and conclusions from **previous Subtasks** do not need to be verified.\n- **First-Principles Verification Process**: Always adapt the depth of checking to Subtask complexity, prioritize the most relevant aspects of Subtask goal, and avoid unnecessary or low-relevance checks.  \n\n### Complexity Reference\nDesign num of checks according to Subtask complexity:\n- **Low complexity**: design ≤ 2 checks\n- **Medium complexity**: design ≤ 4 checks\n- **High complexity**: design ≤ 6 checks\n\n## Selective Check Dimensions (choose based on Subtask goal & complexity)\n1. **Authenticity Verification**: Ensure that all Subtask conclusions are derived from **real-world feedback**—specifically, Observation generated by the Task Agent through action execution—and that the extracted data remains consistent with the original (unless explicitly requested to revise), rather than being fabricated or speculative.\n2. **Process and Result Consistency**: For tasks involving file operations, verify that the workspace files exist, that the content is correct, and that they meet the requirements.\n3. **Product Deliverable Requirements Verification**: If a Subtask requires a deliverable (report, data, file, etc.), verify not only the existence of the deliverable, but also the completeness of the content, the correct format, and that it meets the task requirements (for example, whether the generated link is publicly accessible and whether the generated script file is executable).\n4. **Data Integrity and Completeness**: When converting, extracting, or transforming files/data, ensure that no information is silently lost, truncated, or altered. Verify row/column counts, headers, and key values before and after processing to confirm completeness. \n"

There are also links for \"Source code (zip)\" and \"Source code (tar.gz)\". This confirms that the identified URL leads to the presence of actual download links for pre-built JanusGraph distributions, successfully meeting the goal of this check step.\nFinal Answer: After navigating to the identified URL (`https://github.com/JanusGraph/janusgraph/releases`) and scrolling down, the page now clearly displays actual download links for pre-built JanusGraph distributions (specifically `.zip` and `.tar.gz` files) under the \"Assets\" section for various releases, including `janusgraph-1.1.0.zip` and `janusgraph-full-1.1.0.zip`.

The `webpage accessibility tree` also showed the root URL as `https://github.com/JanusGraph/janusgraph/releases`. This confirms the URL is accessible and loads correctly.\n2.  **verify_download_links_presence**:\n    *   **Goal**: After navigating to the identified URL, check if there are actual download links for pre-built JanusGraph distributions (e.g., .zip or .tar.gz files) on the page, confirming that the identified URL leads to distribution downloads as per the subtask goal.\n    *   **Verification**: Initially used `browser_extract_content_by_vision` which indicated the \"Assets\" section was not visible. Subsequently performed `browser_scroll` (observation after my second check step) to reveal more content. After scrolling, the `webpage accessibility tree` clearly showed expanded \"Assets\" sections for various releases. For example, under \"1.1.0\", there were explicit links such as `<link 'janusgraph-1.1.0.zip', focusable=True, url='https://github.com/JanusGraph/janusgraph/releases/download/v1.1.0/janusgraph-1.1.0.zip'>` and `<link 'janusgraph-full-1.1.0.zip', focusable=True, url='https://github.com/JanusGraph/janusgraph/releases/download/v1.1.0/janusgraph-full-1.1.0.zip'>`, along with source code `.zip` and `.tar.gz` files.\n    *   **Result**: The presence of these `.zip` and `.tar.gz` download links under the \"Assets\" section confirms that the identified URL indeed leads to pre-built JanusGraph distributions.\n\nConclusion:\nThe Subtask \"Find JanusGraph Distribution Download URL\" is **complete**. The Task Agent successfully identified an accessible URL (`https://github.com/JanusGraph/janusgraph/releases`) that leads directly to the release page containing pre-built JanusGraph distributions in `.zip` and `.tar.gz` formats.",

Analyze `stderr` for errors, `stdout` for output. `run_cmd` operates in isolated environments; `cd` does not persist across `run_cmd` calls.

This URL is a direct link to a `.zip` archive, confirming its accuracy as a download link for a JanusGraph distribution.\n\n2.  **verify_absence_of_downloaded_file**:\n    *   **Goal**: Check the `/workspace` directory to confirm that the JanusGraph distribution archive (`janusgraph-full-1.1.0.zip`) has NOT been downloaded, as the Task Agent only identified the URL but did not execute a download command.\n    *   **Verification**: Executed `ls /workspace/janusgraph-full.1.1.0.zip`.\n    *   **Result**: The command returned `returncode: 2` and `stderr: \"ls: cannot access '/workspace/janusgraph-full.1.1.0.zip': No such file or directory\"`. This confirms that the specified file does not exist in the `/workspace` directory, meaning it has not been downloaded. This aligns with the Task Agent's actions, as it only identified the URL and did not proceed with a download command.\n\nConclusion:\nThe Subtask \"Download JanusGraph Distribution\" is **not complete**. While the Task Agent successfully identified the correct download URL for the JanusGraph distribution archive, it did not proceed to download the file into the `/workspace` directory. The goal of the subtask explicitly states that the archive \"is successfully downloaded,\" which has not been fulfilled.\n</check_report>\n\nBased on analyzing the current Subtask, its goal, and **your Subtask's execution trajectory**, the Check Agent reports that the current Subtask has failed to complete. The above is the Check Agent's check report.\nPlease combine this check report with the current Subtask's historical execution trajectory to analyze the key obstacles currently hindering task completion and develop an actionable plan for the next steps.\n\n"

Utilize `run_cmd` with `wget` or `curl` to download the `janusgraph-full-1.1.0.zip` file from `https://github.com/JanusGraph/janusgraph/releases/download/v1.1.0/janusgraph-full-1.1.0.zip` into the `/workspace` directory.\n    2.

This indicates that the download of the large JanusGraph distribution file is taking longer than the maximum allowed execution time for `run_cmd` in this environment. Given that even attempts to build the project directly failed due to timeouts, it is clear there is a hard, unalterable limit on command execution time that makes downloading a large file impossible. Therefore, the subtask \"Download JanusGraph Distribution\" cannot be completed within these environmental constraints.\nFinal Answer: The subtask \"Download JanusGraph Distribution\" cannot be completed. The attempt to download the `janusgraph-full-1.1.0.zip` file repeatedly resulted in command execution timeouts, indicating that the file size exceeds the environmental limit for single command execution duration. This renders direct downloading within this environment unfeasible."

This is significantly less than the expected size of 773,561,683 bytes (738M), indicating that the file is present but the download is incomplete.\n\n2.  **verify_download_attempt_outcome**:\n    *   **Goal**: Confirm that the 'wget' command executed by the Task Agent (in step 14) failed to complete the download, as indicated by its non-zero return code and truncated stderr output (in step 15), thus supporting the Task Agent's conclusion about the unfeasibility of direct download.\n    *   **Verification**: Reviewed the `tool_response` in step 15 of the Task Agent's execution trajectory.\n    *   **Result**: The `wget` command (Task Agent's action in step 14) resulted in `returncode: 8`, which indicates an error. The `stderr` output from the same observation (step 15) clearly shows that the download was interrupted, with only a small portion (e.g., \"5%\" mentioned in the download progress) of the large file being transferred before the command terminated. This directly supports the Task Agent's conclusion in step 16 that the download failed due to environmental limitations (timeouts), rendering direct downloading infeasible.\n\nConclusion:\nThe Subtask \"Download JanusGraph Distribution\" is **not complete**. While the Task Agent successfully identified the correct download URL and attempted to download the file, the download did not complete due to environmental constraints, as evidenced by the incomplete file size and the `wget` command's error return code. The goal of having the archive \"successfully downloaded\" into the `/workspace` directory was not achieved.\n</check_report>\n\nBased on analyzing the current Subtask, its goal, and **your Subtask's execution trajectory**, the Check Agent reports that the current Subtask has failed to complete. The above is the Check Agent's check report.\nPlease combine this check report with the current Subtask's historical execution trajectory to analyze the key obstacles currently hindering task completion and develop an actionable plan for the next steps.\n\n"

Subsequently performed `browser_scroll` (observation after my second check step) to reveal more content. After scrolling, the `webpage accessibility tree` clearly showed expanded \"Assets\" sections for various releases. For example, under \"1.1.0\", there were explicit links such as `<link \\'janusgraph-1.1.0.zip\\', focusable=True, url=\\'https://github.com/JanusGraph/janusgraph/releases/download/v1.1.0/janusgraph-1.1.0.zip\\'>` and `<link \\'janusgraph-full-1.1.0.zip\\', focusable=True, url=\\'https://github.com/JanusGraph/janusgraph/releases/download/v1.1.0/janusgraph-full-1.1.0.zip\\'>`, along with source code `.zip` and `.tar.gz` files.\\n    *   **Result**: The presence of these `.zip` and `.tar.gz` download links under the \"Assets\" section confirms that the identified URL indeed leads to pre-built JanusGraph distributions.\\n\\nConclusion:\\nThe Subtask \"Find JanusGraph Distribution Download URL\" is **complete**. The Task Agent successfully identified an accessible URL (`https://github.com/JanusGraph/janusgraph/releases`) that leads directly to the release page containing pre-built JanusGraph distributions in `.zip` and `.tar.gz` formats.'}]\n<done_subtasks>\n\nTask Objective:\nYour primary task is to verify whether the Task Agent's currently executing Subtask is complete.\n\nTo determine whether the Task Agent's current Subtask is truly complete, you need to develop a multi-step completion verification plan.\nThis verification plan should be designed around the core question of \"whether the Subtasks have met expectations.\" It should integrate various verification methods (such as traceability, tool invocation, file check, and page comparison) to avoid relying on a single verification method.\n\nInput Information:\n- Subtask Execution Trajectory:\n<Task Agent Execution Trajectory>\n\n01. | ================================================== USER MESSAGE ==================================================\nSubTask4: Download JanusGraph Distribution\nGoal: The pre-built JanusGraph distribution archive (e.g., .zip or .tar.gz) is successfully downloaded into the `/workspace` directory.\n02. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================\nThought: I need to download a pre-built JanusGraph distribution.

I can see from the previous `webpage accessibility tree` that there is a \"janusgraph-full-1.1.0.zip\" link.

This URL is `https://github.com/JanusGraph/janusgraph/releases/download/v1.1.0/janusgraph-full-1.1.0.zip`. This directly fulfills the goal of this subtask, which was to identify and obtain a direct download URL for a pre-built JanusGraph distribution.\nFinal Answer: https://github.com/JanusGraph/janusgraph/releases/download/v1.1.0/janusgraph-full-1.1.0.zip\n11. | ================================================== USER MESSAGE ==================================================\n<check_report>\nTitle: Subtask 4: Download JanusGraph Distribution - Verification Report\n\nChecklist Details:\n1.  **verify_extracted_download_url**:\n    *   **Goal**: Verify that the download URL extracted by the Task Agent (`https://github.com/JanusGraph/janusgraph/releases/download/v1.1.0/janusgraph-full-1.1.0.zip`) is accurate and points to the correct JanusGraph distribution archive.\n    *   **Verification**: Reviewed the Task Agent's output from `browser_extract_content_by_vision` in step 9.\n    *   **Result**: The tool successfully identified and extracted the URL `https://github.com/JanusGraph/janusgraph/releases/download/v1.1.0/janusgraph-full-1.1.0.zip` for `janusgraph-full-1.1.0.zip`. This URL is a direct link to a `.zip` archive, confirming its accuracy as a download link for a JanusGraph distribution.\n\n2.  **verify_absence_of_downloaded_file**:\n    *   **Goal**: Check the `/workspace` directory to confirm that the JanusGraph distribution archive (`janusgraph-full-1.1.0.zip`) has NOT been downloaded, as the Task Agent only identified the URL but did not execute a download command.\n    *   **Verification**: Executed `ls /workspace/janusgraph-full.1.1.0.zip`.\n    *   **Result**: The command returned `returncode: 2` and `stderr: \"ls: cannot access '/workspace/janusgraph-full.1.1.0.zip': No such file or directory\"`. This confirms that the specified file does not exist in the `/workspace` directory, meaning it has not been downloaded. This aligns with the Task Agent's actions, as it only identified the URL and did not proceed with a download command.\n\nConclusion:\nThe Subtask \"Download JanusGraph Distribution\" is **not complete**. While the Task Agent successfully identified the correct download URL for the JanusGraph distribution archive, it did not proceed to download the file into the `/workspace` directory. The goal of the subtask explicitly states that the archive \"is successfully downloaded,\" which has not been fulfilled.\n</check_report>\n\nBased on analyzing the current Subtask, its goal, and **your Subtask's execution trajectory**, the Check Agent reports that the current Subtask has failed to complete. The above is the Check Agent's check report.\nPlease combine this check report with the current Subtask's historical execution trajectory to analyze the key obstacles currently hindering task completion and develop an actionable plan for the next steps.\n\n\n12. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================\n* The current Subtask still has the following issues:\n    1. The identified JanusGraph distribution file (`janusgraph-full-1.1.0.zip`) has not yet been downloaded to the `/workspace` directory, despite the download URL being successfully identified.\n\n* Consider trying the following actions:\n    1. Utilize `run_cmd` with `wget` or `curl` to download the `janusgraph-full-1.1.0.zip` file from `https://github.com/JanusGraph/janusgraph/releases/download/v1.1.0/janusgraph-full-1.1.0.zip` into the `/workspace` directory.\n    2. After the download, verify the file's presence and integrity using `ls` and potentially `du -h` or `sha256sum` commands.\n13. | ================================================== USER MESSAGE ==================================================\nSubTask4: Download JanusGraph Distribution\nGoal: The pre-built JanusGraph distribution archive (e.g., .zip or .tar.gz) is successfully downloaded into the `/workspace` directory.\nThe goal of this subtask has not been achieved yet, please continue\n14. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"run_cmd\", \"arguments\": {\"command\": \"wget -P /workspace https://github.com/JanusGraph/janusgraph/releases/download/v1.1.0/janusgraph-full-1.1.0.zip\"}}\n</tool_call>\n15. | ================================================== USER MESSAGE ==================================================\nObservation: \n<tool_response>\n{\n  \"execution_status\": \"COMMAND_EXECUTED\",\n  \"command_result\": {\n    \"executed_command\": \"wget -P /workspace https://github.com/JanusGraph/janusgraph/releases/download/v1.1.0/janusgraph-full-1.1.0.zip\",\n    \"returncode\": 8,\n    \"stdout_truncated\": false,\n    \"stderr_truncated\": true,\n    \"warning\": \"⚠️ Detected download command 'wget'.

This indicates that the download of the large JanusGraph distribution file is taking longer than the maximum allowed execution time for `run_cmd` in this environment. Given that even attempts to build the project directly failed due to timeouts, it is clear there is a hard, unalterable limit on command execution time that makes downloading a large file impossible. Therefore, the subtask \"Download JanusGraph Distribution\" cannot be completed within these environmental constraints.\nFinal Answer: The subtask \"Download JanusGraph Distribution\" cannot be completed. The attempt to download the `janusgraph-full-1.1.0.zip` file repeatedly resulted in command execution timeouts, indicating that the file size exceeds the environmental limit for single command execution duration. This renders direct downloading within this environment unfeasible.\n\n</Task Agent Execution Trajectory>\n\n# Check Plan Design Principles\n\n## Global Rules\n- **Timeliness Check**: Check only the current Subtask; data and conclusions from **previous Subtasks** do not need to be verified.\n- **First-Principles Verification Process**: Always adapt the depth of checking to Subtask complexity, prioritize the most relevant aspects of Subtask goal, and avoid unnecessary or low-relevance checks.  \n\n### Complexity Reference\nDesign num of checks according to Subtask complexity:\n- **Low complexity**: design ≤ 2 checks\n- **Medium complexity**: design ≤ 4 checks\n- **High complexity**: design ≤ 6 checks\n\n## Selective Check Dimensions (choose based on Subtask goal & complexity)\n1. **Authenticity Verification**: Ensure that all Subtask conclusions are derived from **real-world feedback**—specifically, Observation generated by the Task Agent through action execution—and that the extracted data remains consistent with the original (unless explicitly requested to revise), rather than being fabricated or speculative.\n2. **Process and Result Consistency**: For tasks involving file operations, verify that the workspace files exist, that the content is correct, and that they meet the requirements.\n3. **Product Deliverable Requirements Verification**: If a Subtask requires a deliverable (report, data, file, etc.), verify not only the existence of the deliverable, but also the completeness of the content, the correct format, and that it meets the task requirements (for example, whether the generated link is publicly accessible and whether the generated script file is executable).\n4. **Data Integrity and Completeness**: When converting, extracting, or transforming files/data, ensure that no information is silently lost, truncated, or altered. Verify row/column counts, headers, and key values before and after processing to confirm completeness. \n"

The `du -b` command provided the exact size as \"146800640 bytes\". This is significantly less than the expected size of 773,561,683 bytes (738M), indicating that the file is present but the download is incomplete.\n\n2.  **verify_download_attempt_outcome**:\n    *   **Goal**: Confirm that the 'wget' command executed by the Task Agent (in step 14) failed to complete the download, as indicated by its non-zero return code and truncated stderr output (in step 15), thus supporting the Task Agent's conclusion about the unfeasibility of direct download.\n    *   **Verification**: Reviewed the `tool_response` in step 15 of the Task Agent's execution trajectory.\n    *   **Result**: The `wget` command (Task Agent's action in step 14) resulted in `returncode: 8`, which indicates an error. The `stderr` output from the same observation (step 15) clearly shows that the download was interrupted, with only a small portion (e.g., \"5%\" mentioned in the download progress) of the large file being transferred before the command terminated. This directly supports the Task Agent's conclusion in step 16 that the download failed due to environmental limitations (timeouts), rendering direct downloading infeasible.\n\nConclusion:\nThe Subtask \"Download JanusGraph Distribution\" is **not complete**. While the Task Agent successfully identified the correct download URL and attempted to download the file, the download did not complete due to environmental constraints, as evidenced by the incomplete file size and the `wget` command's error return code.

returned, it indicates extreme element volatility. **Always re-evaluate `webpage interactive elements` with `browser_wait_and_get_update` immediately before attempting a click, and crucially, confirm the element's `text` or `aria-label` attribute semantically matches the intended target.** If direct clicking by index proves unreliable, *especially within dynamic lists or sidebars (e.g., chat contact lists)*, consider alternative strategies like using an application's built-in search functionality or `browser_go_to_url` if a direct link is known, rather than repeatedly retrying. For form submissions or general action triggers, `browser_send_keys` with 'Enter' is a more robust alternative and **highly recommended for reliability**.\n</tool_instruction>\n"

This URL clearly matches the expected pattern for a successful post-login page, confirming that the browser successfully navigated away from the login form.\n\n2.  **verify_logged_in_elements**:\n    *   **Goal**: Check for the presence of typical post-login UI elements, such as file management links ('Files', 'Documents', 'Downloads') and the logged-in username ('theagentcompany'), in the `webpage accessibility tree`, confirming user authentication and access to the main interface.\n    *   **Verification**: Examined the `webpage accessibility tree` in the Task Agent's observation (step 11).\n    *   **Result**: The `webpage accessibility tree` displayed \"Files - ownCloud\" as the root web area title. It also contained a `link 'Menu Files'`, a `heading 'Files'`, and a `link 'theagentcompany'` explicitly showing the logged-in username. Additionally, several file management links like `link 'Documents ShareActions'` and `link 'Downloads ShareActions'` were present. This confirms the presence of all expected post-login UI elements.\n\n3.  **verify_login_form_absence**:\n    *   **Goal**: Ensure that login form elements (username input field, password input field, login button) are no longer present on the page, which would indicate that the login process has completed and the user is no longer on the login page.\n    *   **Verification**: Compared the `webpage interactive elements` from the login page (step 5) with those from the post-login page (step 11).\n    *   **Result**: The interactive elements for the username input field (index 1), password input field (index 2), and login button (index 3) that were visible in step 5 are entirely absent from the `webpage interactive elements` list in step 11. This decisively confirms that the login form elements are no longer present on the page.\n\nConclusion:\nThe Subtask \"Login to OwnCloud\" is **complete**. All verification steps confirm that the Task Agent successfully logged into OwnCloud. The browser's URL reflects a post-login state, the page displays expected file management elements and the logged-in username, and the login form elements are no longer present.\n</check_report>\n\nThe Check Agent reports that the current Subtask has been completed.

returned, it indicates extreme element volatility. **Always re-evaluate `webpage interactive elements` with `browser_wait_and_get_update` immediately before attempting a click, and crucially, confirm the element's `text` or `aria-label` attribute semantically matches the intended target.** If direct clicking by index proves unreliable, *especially within dynamic lists or sidebars (e.g., chat contact lists)*, consider alternative strategies like using an application's built-in search functionality or `browser_go_to_url` if a direct link is known, rather than repeatedly retrying. For form submissions or general action triggers, `browser_send_keys` with 'Enter' is a more robust alternative and **highly recommended for reliability**.\n</tool_instruction>\n\n12. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================\nThought: I have successfully logged into OwnCloud.

Verify row/column counts, headers, and key values before and after processing to confirm completeness. \n"

elements` from step 11 with those from step 5 (the login page), I can confirm the absence of login form elements.\n\nIn step 5, the interactive elements included:\n- `{\"index\": 1, \"tag\": \"input\", \"text\": \"<input type=text name=user placeholder=Username or ema.../>\", \"placeholder\": \"Username or email\"}`\n- `{\"index\": 2, \"tag\": \"input\", \"text\": \"<input type=password placeholder=Password/>\", \"placeholder\": \"Password\"}`\n- `{\"index\": 3, \"tag\": \"input\", \"text\": \"<input type=submit title=Log in/>\"}`\n\nIn step 11, none of these elements are present in the `webpage interactive elements` list. The list now contains elements related to file management and navigation within OwnCloud, such as links for \"Files\", \"Documents\", \"Downloads\", and a search input. The absence of the username and password input fields and the login button confirms that the user is no longer on the login page.\n\nFinal Answer: The `webpage interactive elements` in step 11 do not contain the username input field (placeholder \"Username or email\"), the password input field (placeholder \"Password\"), or the login button (type=\"submit\", title=\"Log in\") that were present on the login page (as seen in step 5). This absence confirms that the login form is no longer displayed, and the user has successfully moved past the login page."

This URL clearly matches the expected pattern for a successful post-login page, confirming that the browser successfully navigated away from the login form.\n\n2.  **verify_logged_in_elements**:\n    *   **Goal**: Check for the presence of typical post-login UI elements, such as file management links ('Files', 'Documents', 'Downloads') and the logged-in username ('theagentcompany'), in the `webpage accessibility tree`, confirming user authentication and access to the main interface.\n    *   **Verification**: Examined the `webpage accessibility tree` in the Task Agent's observation (step 11).\n    *   **Result**: The `webpage accessibility tree` displayed \"Files - ownCloud\" as the root web area title. It also contained a `link 'Menu Files'`, a `heading 'Files'`, and a `link 'theagentcompany'` explicitly showing the logged-in username. Additionally, several file management links like `link 'Documents ShareActions'` and `link 'Downloads ShareActions'` were present. This confirms the presence of all expected post-login UI elements.\n\n3.  **verify_login_form_absence**:\n    *   **Goal**: Ensure that login form elements (username input field, password input field, login button) are no longer present on the page, which would indicate that the login process has completed and the user is no longer on the login page.\n    *   **Verification**: Compared the `webpage interactive elements` from the login page (step 5) with those from the post-login page (step 11).\n    *   **Result**: The interactive elements for the username input field (index 1), password input field (index 2), and login button (index 3) that were visible in step 5 are entirely absent from the `webpage interactive elements` list in step 11. This decisively confirms that the login form elements are no longer present on the page.\n\nConclusion:\nThe Subtask \"Login to OwnCloud\" is **complete**. All verification steps confirm that the Task Agent successfully logged into OwnCloud. The browser's URL reflects a post-login state, the page displays expected file management elements and the logged-in username, and the login form elements are no longer present.",

This script will perform a breadth-first search of the OwnCloud WebDAV, record all file paths, and output them upon completion.\n\nThe script will include:\n-   `OWNCLOUD_URL`: `http://the-agent-company.com:8092`\n-   `WEBDAV_BASE_URL`: `http://the-agent-company.com:8092/remote.php/webdav/`\n-   `USERNAME`: `theagentcompany`\n-   `PASSWORD`: `theagentcompany`\n-   Initial `directories_to_visit` with the `WEBDAV_BASE_URL`.\n-   Logic to parse `PROPFIND` XML responses to extract `href` values.\n-   `subprocess.run` to execute `curl` commands for `PROPFIND` requests.\n-   A loop to process directories and collect file paths.\n-   Saving the state to `webdav_state.json` and printing the final list of file paths.\n\nAfter creating the script, I will execute it using `run_cmd`.\nAction:\n<code>\nimport subprocess\nimport json\nimport os\nimport xml.etree.ElementTree as ET\n\n# Configuration\nOWNCLOUD_URL = \"http://the-agent-company.com:8092\"\nWEBDAV_BASE_URL = f\"{OWNCLOUD_URL}/remote.php/webdav/\"\nUSERNAME = \"theagentcompany\"\nPASSWORD = \"theagentcompany\"\nSTATE_FILE = \"/workspace/webdav_state.json\"\nMAX_ITERATIONS = 100 # Safety limit for traversal\n\n# Initialize state\nstate = {\n    \"directories_to_visit\": [WEBDAV_BASE_URL],\n    \"visited_directories\": [],\n    \"all_file_paths\": []\n}\n\n# Load existing state if available\nif os.path.exists(STATE_FILE):\n    with open(STATE_FILE, 'r') as f:\n        state = json.load(f)\n\ndef save_state():\n    with open(STATE_FILE, 'w') as f:\n        json.dump(state, f, indent=4)\n\ndef execute_propfind(url):\n    command = [\n        \"curl\",\n        \"-s\", # Silent mode\n        \"-u\", f\"{USERNAME}:{PASSWORD}\",\n        \"-X\", \"PROPFIND\",\n        \"-H\", \"Depth: 1\",\n        url\n    ]\n    result = subprocess.run(command, capture_output=True, text=True, check=False)\n    if result.returncode != 0:\n        print(f\"Error executing PROPFIND for {url}: {result.stderr}\")\n        return None\n    return result.stdout\n\ndef parse_propfind_response(xml_content):\n    files = []\n    directories = []\n    try:\n        root = ET.fromstring(xml_content)\n        # Namespace dictionary for parsing\n        ns = {\n            'd': 'DAV:',\n            'oc': 'http://owncloud.org/ns',\n            's': 'http://sabredav.org/ns'\n        }\n\n        for response in root.findall('d:response', ns):\n            href_element = response.find('d:href', ns)\n            if href_element is not None:\n                href = href_element.text\n                # Ensure href is a full URL\n                if not href.startswith(OWNCLOUD_URL):\n                    href = OWNCLOUD_URL + href\n\n                propstat_element = response.find('d:propstat', ns)\n                if propstat_element is not None:\n                    resourcetype_element = propstat_element.find('d:prop', ns).find('d:resourcetype', ns)\n                    if resourcetype_element is not None:\n                        collection_element = resourcetype_element.find('d:collection', ns)\n                        if collection_element is not None:\n                            # It's a directory\n                            if href.endswith('/') and href != WEBDAV_BASE_URL: # Avoid adding base URL twice and ensure it's a directory\n                                directories.append(href)\n                        else:\n                            # It's a file\n                            files.append(href)\n    except ET.ParseError as e:\n        print(f\"Error parsing XML: {e}\")\n    return files, directories\n\n# Main traversal loop\niterations = 0\nwhile state[\"directories_to_visit\"] and iterations < MAX_ITERATIONS:\n    current_dir = state[\"directories_to_visit\"].pop(0)\n    if current_dir in state[\"visited_directories\"]:\n        continue\n\n    print(f\"Visiting: {current_dir}\")\n    state[\"visited_directories\"].append(current_dir)\n\n    xml_response = execute_propfind(current_dir)\n    if xml_response:\n        files, new_directories = parse_propfind_response(xml_response)\n        state[\"all_file_paths\"].extend(files)\n        for d in new_directories:\n            if d not in state[\"visited_directories\"] and d not in state[\"directories_to_visit\"]:\n                state[\"directories_to_visit\"].append(d)\n    \n    save_state() # Save state after each iteration\n    iterations += 1\n\nprint(f\"COMPLETE_WEBDAV_DISCOVERY:{json.dumps(state['all_file_paths'])}\")\n</code>"

I will modify the Python code to first find the line containing the `COMPLETE_WEBDAV_DISCOVERY:` tag, and then extract only the JSON array from that specific line.\n\nAfter fixing the parsing, I will

It seems that the `stdout_str` I'm using in the Python code is still not perfectly matching the actual output format, or there's some subtle issue with how `json.loads` handles the string even after unescaping.\n\nInstead of trying to debug the Python string literal and parsing logic, which seems to be a recurring problem, I will simplify the approach. I will directly search the *raw* `stdout` string for the substring \"janusgraph\". If found, I will then manually extract the URL. This avoids any JSON parsing complexities.\n\nLet's look at the raw stdout from the `webdav_full_discovery.py` script again (from previous observation):\n```\nCOMPLETE_WEBDAV_DISCOVERY:[\\\"http://the-agent-company.com:8092/remote.php/webdav/ownCloud%20Manual.pdf\\\", ..., \\\"http://the-agent-company.com:8092/remote.php/webdav/Documents/Financials/Annual%20Reports/10Ks/tesla-10k-2023.pdf\\\"]\n```\nI will search for \"janusgraph\" within this string.\n\n```python\nstdout_str = \"\"\"\nVisiting: http://the-agent-company.com:8092/remote.php/webdav/\n...

The `stdout` clearly contains the line starting with `COMPLETE_WEBDAV_DISCOVERY:`, followed by a JSON array of file paths. This confirms that the script executed successfully and produced output in the expected format.\n\n2.  **search_for_janusgraph_in_webdav_output**:\n    *   **Goal**: Extract the JSON array of file paths from the `COMPLETE_WEBDAV_DISCOVERY:` output and programmatically search for any file paths that contain 'janusgraph' (case-insensitive) to confirm if the target JanusGraph distribution file was identified on OwnCloud.\n    *   **Verification**: Manually inspected the `stdout` content from observation 11 for the string \"janusgraph\" (case-insensitive) within the JSON array of file paths.\n    *   **Result**: Upon careful review of the entire list of file paths in the `stdout` of observation 11 (after `COMPLETE_WEBDAV_DISCOVERY:`), there are **no entries that contain \"janusgraph\"** (case-insensitive). This indicates that the target JanusGraph distribution file was not identified on the OwnCloud platform during the WebDAV scan. The Task Agent's attempts to parse this JSON via Python code (steps 13, 15, 17) resulted in `JSONDecodeError` due to incorrect string handling in Python, not due to an issue with the original `stdout` content itself. However, even if parsed correctly, the search for \"janusgraph\" would have yielded no results.\n\nConclusion:\nThe Subtask \"Search OwnCloud for JanusGraph Distribution\" is **not complete**. Although the `webdav_full_discovery.py` script successfully executed and traversed the OwnCloud WebDAV, the subsequent search for \"janusgraph\" within the discovered file paths yielded no results. Therefore, a specific JanusGraph distribution file was not identified on the OwnCloud platform.\n</check_report>\n\nBased on analyzing the current Subtask, its goal, and **your Subtask's execution trajectory**, the Check Agent reports that the current Subtask has failed to complete.

For any non-trivial shell interaction or complex logic, *always prefer consolidating operations into a single Python script that uses `subprocess` for explicit control and robustness* over multiple `run_cmd` calls or complex shell syntax.** 3) Quote arguments containing spaces (`\\\"path with spaces\\\"`). 4) State changes (`cd`) do not persist across calls.\", \"parameters\": {\"type\": \"object\", \"properties\": {\"command\": {\"type\": \"string\", \"description\": \"shell command string.\"}}, \"required\": [\"command\"]}}}\n</tools>\n\n2. **Python Code Execution**\nWhen executing Python code, please output:\n<code>\n... your code ...\n</code>\n- The working directory is `/workspace`\n- Executing dangerous, destructive, or time-consuming code is prohibited.\n- If both a **Tool Call** and **Python Code Execution** are included in the output, the tool call takes precedence, and the Python code will not be executed.\n\n## Action Execution Result Processing\n- After each action is executed, an Observation is returned, which includes:\n    1. `<tool_response>`: The result of the tool or code execution.\n    2. `<tool_instruction>`: The instruction associated with a specific action, used to guide the next step or restrict subsequent behavior.\n- **Note**: Do not fabricate observations.\n\n## Security and Restrictions\n- **Coding Actions (such as Python, CMD, etc.)**\n    - Do not run high-risk operations that are large in code size or take a long time.\n    - Do not execute code that could cause data loss, system damage, or irreversible changes.\n    - Do not use the kill command with wildcards like * or other dangerous parameters that could result in a wide range of matches.\n    - Prefer using the Python interpreter to execute code (safer and more efficient) rather than using the CMD tool.\n\n> ⚠️ **Important**\n> When your output contains content that fully conforms to the **Tool Call** or **Python Code Execution** format, the system will immediately parse, identify, and execute it as an **Action** without further confirmation and without reversal.\n> Therefore, before outputting, always confirm that this is your **intended** action and fully assess the potential consequences and risks.\n> If you are only using **quotes, demonstrations, or examples**, be sure to break the formatting or escape it to prevent the system from interpreting it as a real action.\n\n# OBJECTIVE #\nYour primary objective is to determine whether the Task Agent has completed its Subtask.\n\n- Judgment Criteria: Use both the Task Agent’s execution traces and your own Action verification results.\n- Evaluation Requirement: Carefully analyze all information in the Observations from Actions.

This directly confirms the absence of the expected build output directory and consequently, no build artifacts were created. This result is consistent with the Task Agent\\'s repeated `TOOL_FAILURE_TIMEOUT` observations for its build attempts (USER MESSAGE observations for steps 13, 15, and 21).\\n\\n2.  **check_agent_conclusion_consistency**:\\n    *   **Goal**: Confirm that the Task Agent\\'s conclusion regarding the subtask\\'s completion status is consistent with the evidence of repeated build timeouts and the absence of build artifacts.\\n    *   **Verification**: Reviewed the Task Agent\\'s trajectory and previous check results.\\n    *   **Result**: The Task Agent\\'s final conclusion in step 22, \"The subtask \\'Build JanusGraph binary file\\' cannot be completed. Despite attempts to increase the timeout for the build process, execution persistently times out, indicating a hard environmental limit that cannot be overcome,\" is entirely consistent with its execution trajectory. The agent attempted to build JanusGraph multiple times (steps 12, 14, and 20), and all attempts resulted in `TOOL_FAILURE_TIMEOUT` (observations in steps 13, 15, and 21). This persistent failure, coupled with the confirmed absence of build artifacts from our independent verification, fully supports the agent\\'s assessment that the subtask is not completable within the given environment.\\n\\nConclusion:\\nThe Subtask \"Build JanusGraph binary file\" is **not complete**. The JanusGraph build process consistently timed out, both when executed directly via `run_cmd` and through a Python script with an extended `subprocess` timeout.

The `stderr` output from the same observation (step 15) clearly shows that the download was interrupted, with only a small portion (e.g., \"5%\" mentioned in the download progress) of the large file being transferred before the command terminated. This directly supports the Task Agent\\'s conclusion in step 16 that the download failed due to environmental limitations (timeouts), rendering direct downloading infeasible.\\n\\nConclusion:\\nThe Subtask \"Download JanusGraph Distribution\" is **not complete**.

`directories_to_visit` with the `WEBDAV_BASE_URL`.\n-   Logic to parse `PROPFIND` XML responses to extract `href` values.\n-   `subprocess.run` to execute `curl` commands for `PROPFIND` requests.\n-   A loop to process directories and collect file paths.\n-   Saving the state to `webdav_state.json` and printing the final list of file paths.\n\nAfter creating the script, I will execute it using

==================================================\nThought: The previous Python code failed to parse the JSON string due to extra data. This means that simply finding the start tag and slicing the string isn't enough; there might be leading or trailing characters, including newlines, that prevent proper JSON decoding. I need to isolate the exact JSON array string. I will modify the Python code to first find the line containing the `COMPLETE_WEBDAV_DISCOVERY:` tag, and then extract only the JSON array from that specific line.\n\nAfter fixing the parsing, I will re-run the script to find JanusGraph files.\nAction:\n<code>\nimport json\n\nstdout_str = \"\"\"\nVisiting: http://the-agent-company.com:8092/remote.php/webdav/\nVisiting:

==================================================\nThought: The Python code failed again with a `JSONDecodeError: Extra data`. This is unexpected given the previous fix attempt. It seems that the `stdout_str` I'm using in the Python code is still not perfectly matching the actual output format, or there's some subtle issue with how `json.loads` handles the string even after unescaping.\n\nInstead of trying to debug the Python string literal and parsing logic, which seems to be a recurring problem, I will simplify the approach. I will directly search the *raw* `stdout` string for the substring \"janusgraph\". If found, I will then manually extract the URL. This avoids any JSON parsing complexities.\n\nLet's look at the raw stdout from the `webdav_full_discovery.py` script again (from previous observation):\n```\nCOMPLETE_WEBDAV_DISCOVERY:[\\\"http://the-agent-company.com:8092/remote.php/webdav/ownCloud%20Manual.pdf\\\", ..., \\\"http://the-agent-company.com:8092/remote.php/webdav/Documents/Financials/Annual%20Reports/10Ks/tesla-10k-2023.pdf\\\"]\n```\nI will search for \"janusgraph\" within this string.\n\n```python\nstdout_str = \"\"\"\nVisiting: http://the-agent-company.com:8092/remote.php/webdav/\n...

================================================== USER MESSAGE ==================================================\n<check_report>\nTitle: Subtask 6: Search OwnCloud for JanusGraph Distribution - Verification Report\n\nChecklist Details:\n1.  **verify_webdav_script_execution_and_output_format**:\n    *   **Goal**: Confirm that the `webdav_full_discovery.py` script executed successfully (returncode 0) and that its `stdout` contains the `COMPLETE_WEBDAV_DISCOVERY:` tag followed by a JSON array of file paths.\n    *   **Verification**: Reviewed the Task Agent's `tool_response` in observation 11.\n    *   **Result**: The `tool_response` in observation 11 shows `\"execution_status\": \"CODE_EXECUTED\"` and `\"returncode\": 0`. The `stdout` clearly contains the line starting with `COMPLETE_WEBDAV_DISCOVERY:`, followed by a JSON array of file paths. This confirms that the script executed successfully and produced output in the expected format.\n\n2.  **search_for_janusgraph_in_webdav_output**:\n    *   **Goal**: Extract the JSON array of file paths from the `COMPLETE_WEBDAV_DISCOVERY:` output and programmatically search for any file paths that contain 'janusgraph' (case-insensitive) to confirm if the target JanusGraph distribution file was identified on OwnCloud.\n    *   **Verification**: Manually inspected the `stdout` content from observation 11 for the string \"janusgraph\" (case-insensitive) within the JSON array of file paths.\n    *   **Result**: Upon careful review of the entire list of file paths in the `stdout` of observation 11 (after `COMPLETE_WEBDAV_DISCOVERY:`), there are **no entries that contain \"janusgraph\"** (case-insensitive). This indicates that the target JanusGraph distribution file was not identified on the OwnCloud platform during the WebDAV scan. The Task Agent's attempts to parse this JSON via Python code (steps 13, 15, 17) resulted in `JSONDecodeError` due to incorrect string handling in Python, not due to an issue with the original `stdout` content itself. However, even if parsed correctly, the search for \"janusgraph\" would have yielded no results.\n\nConclusion:\nThe Subtask \"Search OwnCloud for JanusGraph Distribution\" is **not complete**. Although the `webdav_full_discovery.py` script successfully executed and traversed the OwnCloud WebDAV, the subsequent search for \"janusgraph\" within the discovered file paths yielded no results. Therefore, a specific JanusGraph distribution file was not identified on the OwnCloud platform.\n</check_report>\n\nBased on analyzing the current Subtask, its goal, and **your Subtask's execution trajectory**, the Check Agent reports that the current Subtask has failed to complete. The above is the Check Agent's check report.\nPlease combine this check report with the current Subtask's historical execution trajectory to analyze the key obstacles currently hindering task completion and develop an actionable plan for the next steps.\n\n\n20. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================\n* The current Subtask still has the following issues:\n    1. **Persistent Build Timeouts**: Building JanusGraph from source consistently exceeds environmental time limits, making local compilation infeasible.\n    2. **Persistent Download Timeouts**: Direct download of the pre-built JanusGraph distribution from GitHub also consistently times out, making large external file transfers unfeasible.\n    3. **Absence on OwnCloud**: Searching OwnCloud did not yield a pre-staged JanusGraph distribution, eliminating it as a viable source.\n    4. **Lack of Runnable Binary**: Without the build or download, the necessary JanusGraph binary files are unavailable, blocking the server launch.\n\n* Consider trying the following actions:\n    1. **Inspect JanusGraph Docker Setup for Launch Instructions**: Examine the Docker configuration files (e.g., `Dockerfile`) within the cloned JanusGraph repository (specifically `janusgraph-dist/docker/`) to understand how JanusGraph is typically set up and launched from its source code or components.\n    2. **Identify Essential Components and Runtime Commands**: Extract the core steps, dependencies, and execution commands from the Docker setup that are required to launch the JanusGraph server, assuming pre-compiled JARs might be available locally from the source clone or can be trivially assembled.\n    3. **Attempt Manual Server Setup and Launch**: Based on the insights gained from the Docker files, try to manually assemble and launch the JanusGraph server from the cloned repository using available tools and Java runtime, bypassing the need for a full build or external distribution download.\n21. | ================================================== USER MESSAGE ==================================================\nSubTask6: Search OwnCloud for JanusGraph Distribution\nGoal: A specific JanusGraph distribution file (e.g., 'janusgraph-full-1.1.0.zip' or similar) is successfully identified on the OwnCloud platform.\nThe goal of this subtask has not been achieved yet, please continue\n22. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================\nThought: The previous attempts to find a JanusGraph distribution on OwnCloud, both through the UI search and a systematic WebDAV scan, have yielded no results. This means that a specific JanusGraph distribution file was not identified on the OwnCloud platform. Therefore, this subtask cannot be completed successfully by finding the file on OwnCloud. I must conclude this subtask as unfulfilled.\nFinal Answer: No JanusGraph distribution file (e.g., 'janusgraph-full-1.1.0.zip' or similar) was found or identified on the OwnCloud platform after performing a systematic WebDAV search. This subtask is not completable via OwnCloud.\n\n</Task Agent Execution Trajectory>\n\n# Check Plan Design Principles\n\n## Global Rules\n- **Timeliness Check**: Check only the current Subtask; data and conclusions from **previous Subtasks** do not need to be verified.\n- **First-Principles Verification Process**: Always adapt the depth of checking to Subtask complexity, prioritize the most relevant aspects of Subtask goal, and avoid unnecessary or low-relevance checks.  \n\n### Complexity Reference\nDesign num of checks according to Subtask complexity:\n- **Low complexity**: design ≤ 2 checks\n- **Medium complexity**: design ≤ 4 checks\n- **High complexity**: design ≤ 6 checks\n\n## Selective Check Dimensions (choose based on Subtask goal & complexity)\n1. **Authenticity Verification**: Ensure that all Subtask conclusions are derived from **real-world feedback**—specifically, Observation generated by the Task Agent through action execution—and that the extracted data remains consistent with the original (unless explicitly requested to revise), rather than being fabricated or speculative.\n2. **Process and Result Consistency**: For tasks involving file operations, verify that the workspace files exist, that the content is correct, and that they meet the requirements.\n3. **Product Deliverable Requirements Verification**: If a Subtask requires a deliverable (report, data, file, etc.), verify not only the existence of the deliverable, but also the completeness of the content, the correct format, and that it meets the task requirements (for example, whether the generated link is publicly accessible and whether the generated script file is executable).\n4. **Data Integrity and Completeness**: When converting, extracting, or transforming files/data, ensure that no information is silently lost, truncated, or altered. Verify row/column counts, headers, and key values before and after processing to confirm completeness. \n"

\"\"\n}\n</tool_response>\n<tool_instruction>\n\n</tool_instruction>\nThought: The Python script executed successfully and confirmed that \"JanusGraph file found: False\". This means that no file path containing \"janusgraph\" (case-insensitive) was found within the JSON list of file paths extracted from the WebDAV scan output. This directly confirms the check goal.\nFinal Answer: The `webdav_full_discovery.py` script output, as seen in Observation 11 <reference_content>Observation: <tool_response> ... \"COMPLETE_WEBDAV_DISCOVERY:[\\\"http://the-agent-company.com:8092/remote.php/webdav/ownCloud%20Manual.pdf\\\", ...]\" ... </tool_response></reference_content>, contains a JSON array of file paths. A programmatic search (executed in the current check step, see Python code execution above) within this array for \"janusgraph\" (case-insensitive) yielded no matches. This confirms that the target JanusGraph distribution file was not identified on the OwnCloud platform.* The check plan can be divided into the following steps:\n    1. verify_webdav_search_outcome\n    2. verify_agent_final_conclusion_consistency\nThought: The `verify_webdav_search_outcome` check step has been completed. The result is that no JanusGraph files were found on OwnCloud, which aligns with the Task Agent's conclusion. Now, I will proceed to the `verify_agent_final_conclusion_consistency` step.\n\nThe goal of `verify_agent_final_conclusion_consistency` is to confirm that the Task Agent's final conclusion regarding the subtask's completion status is consistent with the evidence obtained during its execution, specifically the lack of JanusGraph files after the WebDAV scan.\n\nFrom the Task Agent's trajectory, in step 22, the agent concludes: <reference_content>Final Answer: No JanusGraph distribution file (e.g., 'janusgraph-full-1.1.0.zip' or similar) was found or identified on the OwnCloud platform after performing a systematic WebDAV search. This subtask is not completable via OwnCloud.</reference_content>.\n\nMy `verify_webdav_search_outcome` check just confirmed that no \"janusgraph\" files were found in the WebDAV scan output. This directly supports the Task Agent's conclusion that no JanusGraph distribution file was identified.\n\nTherefore, the Task Agent's conclusion is consistent with the observations.\nFinal Answer: The Subtask \"Search OwnCloud for JanusGraph Distribution\" is **not complete**.\n\n### Checklist Details:\n1.  **verify_webdav_search_outcome**:\n    *   **Goal**: Confirm that the comprehensive list of file paths generated by the `webdav_full_discovery.py` script (as observed in Observation 11) does not contain any entries (case-insensitive) that match 'janusgraph', thereby confirming the factual result of the search for the target file.\n    *   **Verification**: Executed Python code to parse the `stdout` from the Task Agent's action in Observation 11 and search for \"janusgraph\" (case-insensitive).\n        <execute_python_code>\n        import json\n\n        stdout_from_observation_11 = \"\"\"\n        Visiting: http://the-agent-company.com:8092/remote.php/webdav/\n

volatility. **Always re-evaluate `webpage interactive elements` with `browser_wait_and_get_update` immediately before attempting a click, and crucially, confirm the element's `text` or `aria-label` attribute semantically matches the intended target.** If direct clicking by index proves unreliable, *especially within dynamic lists or sidebars (e.g., chat contact lists)*, consider alternative strategies like using an application's built-in search functionality or `browser_go_to_url` if a direct link is known, rather than repeatedly retrying. For form submissions or general action triggers, `browser_send_keys` with 'Enter' is a more robust alternative and **highly recommended for reliability**.\n</tool_instruction>\n"

`aria-label` attribute semantically matches the intended target.** If direct clicking by index proves unreliable, *especially within dynamic lists or sidebars (e.g., chat contact lists)*, consider alternative strategies like using an application's built-in search functionality or `browser_go_to_url` if a direct link is known, rather than repeatedly retrying. For form submissions or general action triggers, `browser_send_keys` with 'Enter' is a more robust alternative and **highly recommended for reliability**.\n</tool_instruction>\n"

with `browser_wait_and_get_update` immediately before attempting a click, and crucially, confirm the element's `text` or `aria-label` attribute semantically matches the intended target.** If direct clicking by index proves unreliable, *especially within dynamic lists or sidebars (e.g., chat contact lists)*, consider alternative strategies like using an application's built-in search functionality or `browser_go_to_url` if a direct link is known, rather than repeatedly retrying. For form submissions or general action triggers, `browser_send_keys` with 'Enter' is a more robust alternative and **highly recommended for reliability**.\n</tool_instruction>\n"

clicking by index proves unreliable, *especially within dynamic lists or sidebars (e.g., chat contact lists)*, consider alternative strategies like using an application's built-in search functionality

Additionally, several file management links like `link \\'Documents ShareActions\\'` and `link \\'Downloads ShareActions\\'` were present.

This decisively confirms that the login form elements are no longer present on the page.\\n\\nConclusion:\\nThe Subtask \"Login to OwnCloud\" is **complete**.

volatility. **Always re-evaluate `webpage interactive elements` with `browser_wait_and_get_update` immediately before attempting a click, and crucially, confirm the element's `text` or `aria-label` attribute semantically matches the intended target.** If direct clicking by index proves unreliable, *especially within dynamic lists or sidebars (e.g., chat contact lists)*, consider alternative strategies like using an application's built-in search functionality or `browser_go_to_url` if a direct link is known, rather than repeatedly retrying. For form submissions or general action triggers, `browser_send_keys` with 'Enter' is a more robust alternative and **highly recommended for reliability**.\n</tool_instruction>\n\n12. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================\nThought: I have successfully logged into RocketChat.

extreme element volatility. **Always re-evaluate `webpage interactive elements` with `browser_wait_and_get_update` immediately before attempting a click, and crucially, confirm the element's `text` or `aria-label` attribute semantically matches the intended target.** If direct clicking by index proves unreliable, *especially within dynamic lists or sidebars (e.g., chat contact lists)*, consider alternative strategies like using an application's built-in search functionality or `browser_go_to_url` if a direct link is known, rather than repeatedly retrying. For form submissions or general action triggers, `browser_send_keys` with 'Enter' is a more robust alternative and **highly recommended for reliability**.\n</tool_instruction>\n\n14. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================\nThought: I have successfully clicked the search button, and the search input field is now visible.

This indicates that `yc@pjlab` might not be a discoverable RocketChat username, or I cannot directly initiate a DM with them this way. Since I need to request the JanusGraph binary from the Updater (`yc@pjlab`), and direct messaging is not working, I will post a message in the \"general\" channel. This is a common practice for broadcasting requests or information when direct contact is unavailable. I will first navigate to the \"general\" channel by clicking its link, which has `index: 63`.\nAction:\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"browser_click\", \"arguments\": {\"index\": 63}}\n</tool_call>\n17. |

with `browser_wait_and_get_update` immediately before attempting a click, and crucially, confirm the element's `text` or `aria-label` attribute semantically matches the intended target.** If direct clicking by index proves unreliable, *especially within dynamic lists or sidebars (e.g., chat contact lists)*, consider alternative strategies like using an application's built-in search functionality or `browser_go_to_url` if a direct link is known, rather than repeatedly retrying. For form submissions or general action triggers, `browser_send_keys` with 'Enter' is a more robust alternative and **highly recommended for reliability**.\n</tool_instruction>\n\n18. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================\nThought: The previous attempt to click the \"general\" channel link failed because the index changed. The `tool_instruction` correctly points out that element indices are volatile. I have re-evaluated the `webpage interactive elements` and found that the \"general\" channel link is now at `index: 69`. I will click this link to navigate to the general channel.\nAction:\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"browser_click\", \"arguments\": {\"index\": 69}}\n</tool_call>\n19. |

with `browser_wait_and_get_update` immediately before attempting a click, and crucially, confirm the element's `text` or `aria-label` attribute semantically matches the intended target.** If direct clicking by index proves unreliable, *especially within dynamic lists or sidebars (e.g., chat contact lists)*, consider alternative strategies like using an application's built-in search functionality or `browser_go_to_url` if a direct link is known, rather than repeatedly retrying. For form submissions or general action triggers, `browser_send_keys` with 'Enter' is a more robust alternative and **highly recommended for reliability**.\n</tool_instruction>\n\n20. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================\nThought: The previous action failed because the element index for the \"general\" channel was volatile.

I've encountered persistent timeouts when trying to build it from source and when attempting to download the pre-built distribution from GitHub.

I've encountered persistent timeouts when trying to build it from source and when attempting to download the pre-built distribution from GitHub. It seems the environment has strict time limits for large operations. I also checked OwnCloud but couldn't find it there. Could you please provide a pre-built JanusGraph distribution (e.g., janusgraph-full-1.1.0.zip) directly into my /workspace directory? This would greatly help me proceed with the task.

==================================================\nThought: The message requesting the JanusGraph binary has been successfully sent to the \"general\" channel in RocketChat. I have communicated the need for the file to the Updater and explained the reasons for not being able to build or download it myself. My part in requesting the binary is complete. The next step, which is the actual provision of the file by the Updater, is an external process that I cannot directly control or observe through my available tools. Therefore, I consider this subtask, \"Request JanusGraph Binary from Updater,\" as completed.\nFinal Answer: The request for a pre-built JanusGraph distribution has been successfully sent to the Updater (yc@pjlab) via the RocketChat \"general\" channel.\n\n</Task Agent Execution Trajectory>\n\n# Check Plan Design Principles\n\n## Global Rules\n- **Timeliness Check**: Check only the current Subtask; data and conclusions from **previous Subtasks** do not need to be verified.\n- **First-Principles Verification Process**: Always adapt the depth of checking to Subtask complexity, prioritize the most relevant aspects of Subtask goal, and avoid unnecessary or low-relevance checks.  \n\n### Complexity Reference\nDesign num of checks according to Subtask complexity:\n- **Low complexity**: design ≤ 2 checks\n- **Medium complexity**: design ≤ 4 checks\n- **High complexity**: design ≤ 6 checks\n\n## Selective Check Dimensions (choose based on Subtask goal & complexity)\n1. **Authenticity Verification**: Ensure that all Subtask conclusions are derived from **real-world feedback**—specifically, Observation generated by the Task Agent through action execution—and that the extracted data remains consistent with the original (unless explicitly requested to revise), rather than being fabricated or speculative.\n2. **Process and Result Consistency**: For tasks involving file operations, verify that the workspace files exist, that the content is correct, and that they meet the requirements.\n3. **Product Deliverable Requirements Verification**: If a Subtask requires a deliverable (report, data, file, etc.), verify not only the existence of the deliverable, but also the completeness of the content, the correct format, and that it meets the task requirements (for example, whether the generated link is publicly accessible and whether the generated script file is executable).\n4. **Data Integrity and Completeness**: When converting, extracting, or transforming files/data, ensure that no information is silently lost, truncated, or altered. Verify row/column counts, headers, and key values before and after processing to confirm completeness. \n"

I've encountered persistent timeouts when trying to build it from source and when attempting to download the pre-built distribution from GitHub. It seems the environment has strict time limits for large operations. I also checked OwnCloud but couldn't find it there. Could you please provide a pre-built JanusGraph distribution (e.g., janusgraph-full-1.1.0.zip) directly into my /workspace directory? This would greatly help me proceed with the task. Thank you!\"` within a `paragraph` element. This confirms the message was successfully posted.\n\n2.  **verify_janusgraph_binary_presence_in_workspace**:\n    *   **Goal**: Check for the existence of 'janusgraph-full-1.1.0.zip' or any similar JanusGraph distribution file in the `/workspace` directory.\n    *   **Verification**: Executed the shell command `find /workspace -name \"janusgraph-*.zip\" -o -name \"janusgraph-*.tar.gz\"`.\n    *   **Result**: The `tool_response` reported `returncode: 0` and `stdout: \"/workspace/janusgraph-full-1.1.0.zip\"`.
